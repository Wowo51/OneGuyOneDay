# RadixSort Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

RadixSort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm that sorts strings by processing each character from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. The algorithm works by performing a stable sort on each character position, starting from the rightmost character and moving to the left. Null string values are handled gracefully by treating them as empty strings.

To use the SourceCode:
1. Include the library in your C# project.
2. Call the Sort method from the RadixSort implementation by passing an array of strings.
3. The method returns a sorted array of strings based on ordinal comparison.
4. Refer to the test project (RadixSortTest) for usage examples and to ensure that the integration works as expected.
