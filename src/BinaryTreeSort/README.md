# Binary Tree Sort Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

BinaryTreeSort algorithm works by constructing a binary tree from an unsorted list. Each element is inserted into the tree according to its value, ensuring that an in-order traversal produces a sorted sequence. The implementation is divided among classes that handle tree construction (BinaryTree and TreeNode) and the sorting operation (TreeSorter). Unit tests written with MSTest are included to validate the functionality and reliability of the algorithm.

To use the SourceCode, add a reference to the BinaryTreeSort project in your C# solution. Then, simply pass your unsorted list to the TreeSorter.Sort method and receive a sorted list as a result. This complete package demonstrates not only the algorithmâ€™s implementation but also practical usage within a fully tested framework.
