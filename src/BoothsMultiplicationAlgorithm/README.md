#Booths Multiplication Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Booth's Multiplication Algorithm is an efficient method for multiplying two signed binary numbers using a combination of shifting and addition/subtraction operations. The algorithm reduces the number of arithmetic operations by encoding sequences of 1s in the binary representation, which minimizes redundant calculations.

To use the SourceCode, first open the solution file (BoothsMultiplicationAlgorithm.sln) in Visual Studio or your preferred .NET IDE. Alternatively, use the .NET CLI by running 'dotnet build' and 'dotnet test' in the project directory. The repository is organized into projects for the algorithm implementation and its unit tests, ensuring easy verification and integration.
