# Zellers Congruence Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Zeller's Congruence algorithm is a mathematical formula used to calculate the day of the week for any given date in both the Gregorian and Julian calendars. It works by converting January and February into the 13th and 14th months of the previous year, then performing a series of arithmetic operations that yield an index corresponding to a day of the week.

To use the SourceCode, add a reference to the ZellersCongruence class library in your project. Then call the CalculateDayOfWeek method from the ZellersCongruenceCalculator class, providing the year, month, day, and the calendar type (Gregorian or Julian). The library is complemented by unit tests that demonstrate its usage and validate its correctness against known date values.
