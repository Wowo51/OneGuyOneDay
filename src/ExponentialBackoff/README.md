# ExponentialBackoff Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The ExponentialBackoff algorithm is a strategy for handling transient failures by retrying an operation with progressively longer delays. It begins with an initial delay and multiplies that delay after each failed attempt—up to a specified maximum—thereby reducing the likelihood of overwhelming the system and allowing time for recovery.

To use the SourceCode, simply include the ExponentialBackoffHelper class in your C# project and call its ExecuteAsync method, passing in your asynchronous operation. You can customize parameters such as maxRetries, initialDelayMs, multiplier, and maxDelayMs according to your requirements. The accompanying unit tests demonstrate typical usage scenarios and validate the algorithm’s behavior.
