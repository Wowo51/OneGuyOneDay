# RSA Digital Signature Implementation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The RsaDigitalSignature algorithm implements RSA-based digital signatures to ensure data integrity and authenticity. It provides methods for generating secure key pairs, signing data using SHA-256 combined with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, and verifying signatures. To use this SourceCode, simply include the library in your project. Begin by generating a key pair with GenerateKeyPair(), sign your data with SignData() using the private key, and verify the signature with VerifySignature() using the public key. Unit tests are provided to demonstrate usage and integration, ensuring that all features work as expected.
