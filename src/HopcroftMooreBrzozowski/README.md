#HopcroftMooreBrzozowskiOverview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The HopcroftMooreBrzozowski algorithm is a synergy of three powerful minimization techniques. It operates by reversing the input DFA, determinizing the resulting NFA, and then reversing again to produce a minimized DFA. This approach combines elements of Hopcroft's partition refinement, Moore's state equivalence, and Brzozowski's double reversal method to achieve efficient minimization.

To use the SourceCode, include the library in your .NET project and run the provided unit tests. The tests demonstrate DFA simulation, minimizer functionality, and synthetic DFA generation. The clear separation of implementation and testing makes it easy to understand, maintain, and extend the algorithm for your automata processing needs.
