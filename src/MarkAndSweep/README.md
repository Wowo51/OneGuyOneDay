# MarkAndSweep Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

== About the MarkAndSweep Algorithm ==
The MarkAndSweep algorithm is a garbage collection technique that operates in two phases. In the Mark phase, the algorithm traverses the object graph starting from designated root objects, marking each reachable object. In the Sweep phase, it collects objects that remain unmarked, reclaiming memory and ensuring efficient resource management.

== Using the SourceCode ==
The provided SourceCode implements the MarkAndSweep algorithm in C#. It includes core files such as GarbageCollector.cs, ObjectNode.cs, and Program.cs, as well as a comprehensive suite of unit tests. To use the SourceCode, compile the project with .NET 9.0 and run the tests using Microsoft's MSTest framework. This setup not only demonstrates the algorithm but also allows you to experiment with and customize the implementation.
