# Hough Transform Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Hough Transform algorithm implemented in this library detects lines in a binary image by transforming points from image space into a parameter space defined by theta (θ) and rho (ρ). Each pixel votes for potential line parameters and an accumulator collects these votes. When the votes for a given (θ, ρ) exceed a specified threshold, a line is detected. This approach is widely used in computer vision to reliably find and characterize straight lines in an image.

To use the SourceCode:
1. Open the solution file "HoughTransform.sln" in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution to compile the library and the test projects.
3. Run the unit tests with MSTest to validate the functionality.
4. Integrate the HoughTransformProcessor class in your project to process images and extract line information.
