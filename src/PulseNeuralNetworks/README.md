#Pulse Neural Networks Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The PulseNeuralNetworks algorithm is a pulse-coupled neural network model inspired by biological vision systems. It processes input images by simulating the asynchronous firing of neurons through iterative integration, dynamic thresholding, and lateral inhibition. By adjusting parameters such as Beta, VF, VL, Decay, and Threshold, the network adapts its firing behavior for tasks like edge detection and texture analysis.

To use the SourceCode, simply add the PulseNeuralNetworks library to your C# project. Create an instance of the PCNN class with your input matrix and desired parameters, then call the Process() method to obtain a binary output matrix. Detailed unit tests demonstrate usage scenarios and ensure the algorithm functions as expected.
