# Differential Evolution Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Differential Evolution (DE) is a population-based stochastic optimization algorithm that optimizes problems over continuous domains using mutation, crossover, and selection processes. The algorithm starts with a randomly generated population of candidate solutions. In each generation, new candidates are produced by combining existing solutions through differential mutation and crossover, and then evaluated using a user-defined objective function. The best candidates survive to form the next generation, steadily improving the overall fitness of the population.

To use the SourceCode provided, open the solution file in a C# development environment such as Visual Studio. The source includes:
- DifferentialEvolutionAlgorithm.cs: Implements the core DE logic.
- DifferentialEvolutionAlgorithmTests.cs: Contains unit tests demonstrating the usage and verifying the algorithm.
- Project files (.sln, .csproj) that organize the source code for building and testing.

Build the project and run the tests to ensure the algorithm works as expected. You can then integrate the library into your own applications for solving continuous optimization problems.
