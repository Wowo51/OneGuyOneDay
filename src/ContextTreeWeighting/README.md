# Context Tree Weighting Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Context Tree Weighting algorithm is designed for efficient binary sequence prediction. It builds a tree structure where each node maintains counts for observed zeros and ones and uses the Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator to compute weighted probabilities. The algorithm recursively blends probabilities from each context node with those computed from its subtree to provide a robust estimate even in the face of sparse data.

To use the SourceCode, open the provided solution file (ContextTreeWeighting.sln) in your .NET development environment. The library is self-contained and includes comprehensive unit tests using MSTest to validate its functionality. Study ContextTreeWeightingAlgorithm.cs for the core algorithm implementation and refer to ContextTreeWeightingTests.cs for usage examples and test scenarios. This enables you to integrate, extend, or modify the algorithm as needed in your projects.
