# ConjugateGradientDocumentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The ConjugateGradientMethods algorithm is an iterative method used to solve systems of linear equations and optimization problems by generating a sequence of conjugate directions. It begins with an initial guess and progressively refines the solution by minimizing the residual error. This approach is especially useful for large, sparse, and symmetric positive-definite matrices.

To use the SourceCode, integrate the library into your C# project and reference it as needed. The library is thoroughly unit tested using Microsoft's unit testing framework to ensure accuracy and robustness. Review the available unit tests to understand typical usage scenarios, and leverage them as a guide when adapting or extending the code for your own applications.
