# Kth Largest Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The KthLargest algorithm is designed to efficiently determine the kth largest element in an unsorted array. It utilizes a QuickSelect strategy similar to the partitioning in QuickSort. By repeatedly partitioning the array and narrowing down the search space based on the pivotâ€™s position, the algorithm quickly converges on the kth largest element. It gracefully handles edge cases by returning null for invalid inputs such as an empty array, a null sequence, or an out-of-range value for k.

To use the SourceCode, include the KthLargest library in your project and call the static method FindKthLargest, passing in your array of integers and the desired rank k. The method returns the kth largest element if valid, and comprehensive unit tests are provided to help you get started and ensure correct behavior in your implementation.
