#Peterson Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Peterson's Algorithm is a classic synchronization mechanism designed to ensure mutual exclusion between two processes in concurrent programming. It employs two flag variables and a turn indicator to prevent race conditions and guarantee that only one process enters the critical section at a time. To use the provided SourceCode, start by reviewing the LICENSE and accompanying documentation. Open the solution file in Microsoft Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE), compile the project, and run the unit tests to verify functionality. This modular implementation serves as both a learning tool and a practical component for synchronizing access in C# applications.
