# RunLengthEncoding Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

RunLengthEncoding is a compression algorithm that encodes consecutive duplicate characters by representing them as a count followed by the character. This approach helps reduce the size of data containing many repeated characters, making it ideal for certain types of text compression.

The provided source code implements this algorithm in C# with two main methods: one to encode a string into its compressed form, and another to decode the compressed string back to its original form. To use the SourceCode, include the library in your project, reference the RunLengthEncoder class, and call its static Encode and Decode methods as needed. Unit tests using MSTest ensure the functionality and reliability of the code.
