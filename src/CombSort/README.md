A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

CombSort is an efficient sorting algorithm that utilizes a shrinking gap mechanism to improve on bubble sort. It begins by comparing elements that are far apart and gradually reduces the gap until the final pass involves adjacent comparisons. This process helps move out-of-place elements quickly and reduces the total number of swaps compared to traditional bubble sort.

To use the SourceCode, include the CombSort library in your C# project, reference its namespace, and call CombSorter.Sort with your array of integers. The solution is organized into separate projects for the library and its unit tests (using MSTest), ensuring that the sorting functionality is both robust and thoroughly verified.
