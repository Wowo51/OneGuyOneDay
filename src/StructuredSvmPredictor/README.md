# StructuredSvmPredictor Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

StructuredSvmPredictor is a structured prediction algorithm that extends conventional SVM techniques to predict categorical and structured outputs. It leverages a core SVM implementation to compute a weighted sum of features and produces predictive labels based on the sign of the computed value. This approach is especially useful for classifications where the output is not merely binary but structured (e.g., labeling sequences or tree structures).

Usage Instructions:
1. Integrate the library into your C# project by referencing the StructuredSvmPredictor assembly.
2. Use the Svm class for standard linear predictions and the StructuredSvm class for obtaining structured labels.
3. You can customize the prediction by setting custom weights via reflection or by extending the provided classes.
4. Run the included MSTest unit tests to verify functionality: they are designed to cover null inputs, empty arrays, and typical feature vectors.
5. Consult the source code comments for further insights into the algorithm design and workflow.

Enjoy exploring and modifying the code as per your project's requirements.
