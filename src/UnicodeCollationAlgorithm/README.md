# Unicode Collation Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Unicode Collation Algorithm is designed to compare Unicode strings in a culturally invariant manner. It normalizes the strings and ignores diacritics and case differences to ensure consistent sorting and matching. To use the SourceCode, simply add a reference to the library in your project and invoke the static Compare method. The implementation leverages .NETâ€™s CompareInfo with IgnoreNonSpace and IgnoreCase options, and the accompanying unit tests demonstrate its usage and validate its functionality.
