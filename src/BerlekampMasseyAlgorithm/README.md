# BerlekampMasseyAlgorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm is a classical algorithm that efficiently computes the minimal polynomial for a given sequence. It finds the shortest linear recurrence relation (connection polynomial) that can generate the sequence, making it an essential tool in coding theory, cryptography, and digital signal processing.

Using the SourceCode:
1. Clone the repository and open the solution file (BerlekampMasseyAlgorithm.sln) in Visual Studio.
2. Build the project targeting .NET 9.0.
3. Run the provided MSTest unit tests in BerlekampMasseyTests.cs to verify the implementation.
4. Incorporate the library into your own applications as needed.
5. Review the LICENSE.md for licensing details.
