# Grid Search Optimization Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Grid Search Optimization is a brute-force algorithm that systematically iterates over a multidimensional grid of parameter values in order to find the parameter combination that minimizes the objective function. The algorithm works by exploring every possible combination of parameters defined by their lower and upper bounds with specified step sizes, ensuring a comprehensive search of the solution space. While effective for small parameter spaces, its computational cost grows exponentially as the number of parameters increases.

To use the SourceCode, simply add the library to your solution. Reference the GridSearch class, define your parameters and objective function, and call the Optimize method to retrieve the best result. Unit tests are provided using MSTest to verify the functionality, so you can confidently modify and extend the implementation to suit your needs.
