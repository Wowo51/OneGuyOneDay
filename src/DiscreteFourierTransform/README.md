#Discrete Fourier Transform Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a fundamental algorithm that converts a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. It works by summing the products of the signal values and complex exponentials to reveal the underlying frequency components. This transformation is essential in signal processing, enabling tasks such as spectral analysis, filtering, and data compression.

To use the SourceCode:
- Build the project with Visual Studio or the .NET CLI.
- Run the provided unit tests to ensure the implementation behaves as expected.
- Reference the compiled library in your own projects to perform frequency analysis.
- Modify or extend the code as needed for custom signal processing applications.
