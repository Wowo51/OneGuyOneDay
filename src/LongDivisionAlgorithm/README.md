# Long Division Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Long Division Algorithm is implemented to simulate the traditional procedure of long division. It clearly demonstrates each step, showing how segments of the dividend are reduced by multiples of the divisor until the full division process—including the final remainder—is complete. This detailed breakdown helps users understand how the subtraction steps lead to the quotient and remainder.

To use the SourceCode, clone the repository and open the provided solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred .NET 9.0-compatible IDE. Compile the project and run the included unit tests to verify functionality. The solution is organized into multiple C# files containing the algorithm implementation, tests, and project configuration, making it straightforward to integrate or extend as needed.
