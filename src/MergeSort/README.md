# MergeSort Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The MergeSort algorithm is a classical divide and conquer sorting method that works by recursively splitting a list into halves, sorting each half independently, and then merging the sorted halves to produce a complete, ordered list. This implementation leverages C# generics, allowing it to sort any collection of elements that implement the IComparable interface.

To use the SourceCode:
1. Open the solution file in Visual Studio or use the .NET CLI for building.
2. Build the MergeSort project to compile the library.
3. Run the MSTest unit tests to verify that the algorithm functions as expected.
4. Integrate or modify the code as needed in your own applications.
