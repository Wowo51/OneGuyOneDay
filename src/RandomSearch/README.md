#RandomSearch Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

RandomSearch is a simple and effective optimization algorithm that explores the solution space by randomly generating candidate solutions within defined lower and upper bounds. The algorithm evaluates each candidate using a provided objective function and retains the best performing candidate over a fixed number of iterations. This technique is particularly useful for problems with large or poorly understood search spaces.

To use the provided SourceCode, open the solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred .NET development environment. The project is organized into separate files for the algorithm, its result handling, and unit tests. The unit tests demonstrate how to set up input bounds and objective functions, allowing you to verify functionality quickly. You can compile and run the tests to ensure everything works as expected, or integrate the library into your own project.
