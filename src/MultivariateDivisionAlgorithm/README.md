# Multivariate Division Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The MultivariateDivisionAlgorithm algorithm is designed to perform division of multivariate polynomials. It takes a given dividend and a list of divisor polynomials, computing the respective quotients and a remainder. The algorithm automatically determines the variable ordering when none is provided, ensuring that terms are processed in the correct order.

The SourceCode comprises a straightforward C# implementation that includes classes for polynomials, terms, and monomials. Comprehensive MSTest unit tests demonstrate its usage in scenarios such as exact division, non-exact division, and cases with zero divisors. To use the SourceCode, integrate the project into your solution via the provided .csproj files and run the test suite to verify functionality.
