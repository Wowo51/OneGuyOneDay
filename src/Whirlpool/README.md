# Whirlpool Hash Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Whirlpool algorithm is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 512-bit digest. It processes data in fixed-size blocks using a series of nonlinear substitutions and linear transformations to ensure security and data integrity. This C# implementation is designed for ease of integration and verification. To use the SourceCode, include the library in your project, instantiate the WhirlpoolHashAlgorithm class, and call its ComputeHash method with your input data. Unit tests are provided to confirm proper functionality.
