# FrankWolfe Algorithm Help

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

FrankWolfeAlgorithm is an iterative first-order method for solving constrained convex optimization problems. It operates by linearizing the objective function at the current iterate and then solving a linear minimization problem over the feasible set to obtain a search direction. This algorithm can efficiently handle problems with complex constraints.

To use the source code, compile the project with .NET 9.0 and run the provided unit tests using Microsoft's MSTest framework. The library structure is modular, allowing you to integrate and extend the vector arithmetic and optimization routines for your own applications. Detailed comments and structured code in the repository will help you understand and modify the implementation as needed.
