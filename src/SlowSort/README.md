#SlowSort Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

SlowSort is a recursive sorting algorithm primarily of theoretical interest. It works by recursively dividing the list into halves, sorting each half, and then swapping elements to produce a sorted array. Although inefficient for large datasets, it serves as an excellent demonstration of recursive algorithm design and problem solving.

To use the SourceCode, compile the C# project using a compatible .NET environment. Run the provided unit tests with Microsoft's MSTest framework to verify functionality. The project is organized with a clear separation between the core sorting logic and its tests, allowing for easy integration and further exploration.
