# Nth Root Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The NthRootAlgorithm algorithm computes the nth root of a number using an iterative approximation. It starts with an initial guess equal to the absolute value of the input and refines this estimate until the difference between successive approximations falls below a specified tolerance. The algorithm handles special cases such as zero input and negative numbers appropriatelyâ€”returning a valid result for odd roots and NaN for even roots when the input is negative.

To use the SourceCode, clone the repository and open the solution file (NthRootAlgorithm.sln) in your preferred .NET development environment. Build the project to compile the library, and run the accompanying unit tests (using, for example, dotnet test) to verify functionality. Refer to the Program.cs file for a sample console application that demonstrates how to use the algorithm.
