# Fermat's Factorization Method

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Fermat's Factorization Method is an algorithm that factors an odd positive integer by expressing it as a difference of two squares. The process begins by taking the ceiling of the square root of the integer and then incrementing this value until the difference between its square and the integer is a perfect square. When a perfect square is found, its square root is used to compute the two factors as (a - b) and (a + b).

To use the source code, open the provided solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE. The repository includes the main library, a command-line application for interactive use, and a suite of unit tests. Build the solution and run either the application or the tests to verify functionality.
