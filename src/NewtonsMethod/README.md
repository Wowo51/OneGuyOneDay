A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Newton's Method, also known as the Newton-Raphson method, is an iterative algorithm for finding the roots of a real-valued function. Starting with an initial guess, the method refines the estimate by subtracting the ratio of the function value to its derivative from the current guess. This process is repeated until the change between successive approximations falls below a specified tolerance.

To use the SourceCode, simply include the provided C# library in your project. The accompanying unit tests demonstrate practical examples of integration and usage. The implementation includes robust error checking—for instance, handling null inputs and near-zero derivatives—to ensure reliable performance across various scenarios.
