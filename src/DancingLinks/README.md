# Dancing Links Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Dancing Links algorithm, also known as Algorithm X, leverages a circular doubly-linked list to efficiently solve exact cover problems. Through clever removal and reinsertion of nodes during backtracking, it finds solutions to puzzles such as Sudoku, polyomino tiling, and other combinatorial challenges.

How to Use the SourceCode:
1. Open the provided solution in Visual Studio or use the dotnet CLI to build the project.
2. Run the integrated unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.
3. Incorporate the library into your own projects to solve exact cover problems or to serve as a basis for custom algorithms.
