# Perceptron Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Perceptron algorithm is a fundamental machine learning method that serves as a binary classifier. It computes a weighted sum of input features and applies a threshold function to output a 0 or 1. During training, the algorithm adjusts its weights and bias iteratively to reduce classification errors, making it a foundational concept in neural networks.

How to use the SourceCode:
- Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
- Build the project to compile the Perceptron library.
- Read through the code in Program.cs for a working example of training and testing.
- Run the provided MSTest unit tests to validate and explore the functionality.
- Integrate the library into your own projects as needed.
