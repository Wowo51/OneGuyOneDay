#Dynamic Time Warping Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a well-known algorithm for measuring the similarity between two temporal sequences that may vary in speed or length. It works by finding an optimal alignment between the sequences through warping the time axis to minimize the overall difference between corresponding elements.

To use the SourceCode:
- Add the DynamicTimeWarping project to your solution.
- Reference the library in your project.
- Call DTW.Compute with your numerical sequences (arrays of doubles) to compute their distance.
- Consult the unit tests for examples of how to integrate and validate the algorithm.
