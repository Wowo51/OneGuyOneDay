# TabuSearchAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

TabuSearchAlgorithm is a metaheuristic that guides a local search procedure to explore the solution space beyond local optima. It uses a dynamic tabu list to prevent cycling back to recent solutions, allowing the algorithm to escape local minima and discover better solutions. At each iteration, a candidate solution is generated by incrementing the current solution, and if the candidate is not in the tabu list and evaluates better than the current best, it is adopted as the new best solution.

How to Use the SourceCode:
1. Open the solution file (TabuSearchAlgorithm.sln) in Visual Studio.
2. Review Program.cs for a demonstration of how to run the algorithm.
3. Examine TabuSearch.cs for the implementation details of the iterative search and tabu list management.
4. Build the project and run the executable to see the Tabu Search Algorithm in action.
5. Run the MSTest unit tests in the TabuSearchAlgorithmTest project to verify functionality.
6. Consult LICENSE.md for licensing information.
