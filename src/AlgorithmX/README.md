#AlgorithmX Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

AlgorithmX is a nondeterministic, recursive, backtracking algorithm designed to solve the exact cover problem. It works by selecting a column with the fewest available options and recursively exploring row combinations that uniquely cover every column. The algorithm efficiently prunes the search space, ensuring that each solution covers all required constraints without overlap.

To use the SourceCode, open the solution file in your preferred IDE (such as Visual Studio), build the project, and run the included unit tests to validate the implementation. The SourceCode package includes project files, build scripts, and comprehensive logs of build and test cycles, which can be referenced for troubleshooting or further development.
