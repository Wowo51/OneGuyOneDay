# Powerset Construction Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Powerset Construction algorithm is an essential method for converting a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). It works by generating states as subsets of the original NFA states and systematically establishing transitions based on the combined possibilities of the NFA. This method is pivotal in automata theory and finds applications in compiler design and various computational tasks.

To use the SourceCode, compile the provided solution using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI. Run the included unit tests to verify functionality, and refer to Program.cs for sample usage. The code is self-contained, well-documented, and maintained under the MIT license, making it easy to integrate and adapt for your project needs.
