# HeapSort Library Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

HeapSort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that utilizes a binary heap data structure. It first transforms the list into a max heap, ensuring that the largest element is at the root. Then, it repeatedly swaps the root with the last element in the unsorted portion, reduces the heap size, and heapifies the new root to restore the heap property. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

To use the source code, open the provided solution file in Visual Studio. The repository includes projects for the HeapSort library and unit tests. Run the tests to verify the implementation and review the examples in the test cases to understand how the HeapSorter class can be integrated into your project.
