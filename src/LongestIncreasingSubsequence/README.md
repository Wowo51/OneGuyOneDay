# Longest Increasing Subsequence

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm identifies the longest subsequence within a given sequence in which the elements are in strictly increasing order. It uses a dynamic programming approach to compute, for each element, the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that element, and then reconstructs the full subsequence by tracking previous indices. This method provides an efficient solution even for moderately large input sequences.

To use the SourceCode, compile the provided C# library project along with its MSTest-based test project. The solution contains unit tests to verify the correctness of the algorithm, and the Program.cs file demonstrates a usage example where an input sequence is processed to extract the longest increasing subsequence. This modular structure makes it easy to integrate the algorithm into other projects or extend its functionality.
