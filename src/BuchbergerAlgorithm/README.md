# Buchberger Algorithm Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Buchberger Algorithm is a method for computing a Gröbner basis for a polynomial ideal. It iteratively calculates S-polynomials between pairs of polynomials and reduces them with respect to the current basis until no new polynomials are generated. This process ensures that every polynomial in the ideal can be reduced to zero when expressed in terms of the computed basis.

How to use the SourceCode:
1. Include the BuchbergerAlgorithm library in your C# project.
2. Create polynomials by instantiating Term and Polynomial objects.
3. Use the GroebnerBasisCalculator.ComputeGroebnerBasis method to compute the Gröbner basis.
4. Run the provided MSTest unit tests to verify functionality.
5. Refer to the sample Program.cs for practical usage examples.
