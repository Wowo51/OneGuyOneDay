#ToomCookMultiplication Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Toom Cook Multiplication is an advanced algorithm for multiplying large numbers more efficiently by splitting them into smaller parts and then recombining the partial results through interpolation. The algorithm is particularly efficient when handling very large numbers and uses a threshold to switch to conventional multiplication for smaller segments. To use the SourceCode, add the project reference to your solution and call the Multiply method from the ToomCookMultiplier class with your input numeric strings. The accompanying unit tests demonstrate usage for various scenarios including null inputs, numbers with leading zeros, and exceptionally large numbers, ensuring robust performance and correctness.
