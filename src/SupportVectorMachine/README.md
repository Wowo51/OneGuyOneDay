A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm that classifies data by finding a hyperplane that best separates classes in a high-dimensional space. The algorithm aims to maximize the margin between data points of differing classes, resulting in robust performance even in complex datasets.

The provided source code includes an SVMClassifier class implementing the SVM algorithm via a gradient-based optimization method. It features a Train method for learning from data and a Predict method for classification, accompanied by unit tests to confirm its functionality.

To use the source code, incorporate the SVMClassifier into your project, adjust parameters like learning rate, regularization, and iterations to suit your needs, and run the included unit tests to verify performance. This self-contained library serves as both a practical tool and an educational reference for applying SVM in C#.
