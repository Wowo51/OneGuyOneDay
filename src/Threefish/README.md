#ThreefishEncryptionLibrary

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Threefish is a modern symmetric-key block cipher known for its simplicity and efficiency. Its design emphasizes operations such as addition, XOR, and bitwise rotation, making it highly suitable for optimized implementations. Developed as part of the Skein hash function family, Threefish is celebrated for both its security and performance. 

To use the provided SourceCode, include the Threefish library in your project and refer to the accompanying unit tests for guidance on initializing the cipher with a key and a tweak, as well as performing encryption and decryption operations. The SourceCode is organized into logical sections with clear examples so that integrating and testing the algorithm becomes straightforward.
