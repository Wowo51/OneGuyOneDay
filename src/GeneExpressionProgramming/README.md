# GeneExpressionProgramming Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Gene Expression Programming algorithm in this library is an evolutionary computation method that evolves solutions by simulating the process of natural evolution. It initializes a population of candidate chromosomes, evaluates their fitness against a predefined target value, and iteratively applies genetic operators such as crossover, mutation, and tournament selection to improve solution quality.

To use the SourceCode, add the project to your C# solution and run the provided unit tests using Microsoft's unit testing framework. You can customize parameters like population size, gene length, mutation rate, and generation count to suit your application's needs. The code is designed for clarity and extensibility, making it an excellent starting point for experimenting with evolutionary computation techniques.
