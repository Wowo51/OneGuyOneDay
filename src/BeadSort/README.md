A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

BeadSort is a natural sorting algorithm that emulates the behavior of beads sliding on an abacus. Each number in an array is represented by beads corresponding to its value; as gravity causes the beads to "fall," they rearrange into a sorted order. This intuitive approach is particularly effective for sorting arrays of non-negative integers with relatively small maximum values.

To use the SourceCode, open the Visual Studio solution file (BeadSort.sln) to view the project structure. The algorithmâ€™s implementation can be found in BeadSorter.cs, while comprehensive unit tests in BeadSorterTests.cs ensure its correctness. This setup allows you to integrate, adapt, and extend the library with ease in your own C# projects.
