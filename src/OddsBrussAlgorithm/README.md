#OddsBrussAlgorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The OddsBrussAlgorithm algorithm is an optimal online search approach derived from principles in optimal stopping theory. It calculates a dynamic threshold based on candidate probabilities and sequentially evaluates outcomes. The algorithm delays selection during an initial non-selection phase and, after reaching the threshold, selects the first candidate that meets the distinguished criteria. If no candidate qualifies later, it automatically selects the final candidate.

How to Use the SourceCode:
- The core implementation is in the OddsAlgorithm class (OddsAlgorithm.cs).
- A sample usage demonstration can be found in Program.cs, which simulates candidate outcomes and shows how to run the algorithm.
- Unit tests are provided in the OddsBrussAlgorithmTest project to verify the correct behavior of the algorithm.
- Build the solution using the provided .csproj files and run tests via MSTest.
- The source files also include licensing and project configuration details to support integration into other C# projects.
