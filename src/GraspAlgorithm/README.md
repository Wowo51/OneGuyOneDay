# GraspAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The GraspAlgorithm uses a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for numerical problems. It constructs an initial solution by randomly selecting candidate values within a defined range, then refines that solution through local search to maximize a score based on proximity to a target value. This iterative process helps in efficiently navigating large solution spaces where exhaustive search is impractical.

To use the provided SourceCode, compile the C# projects using Microsoft Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI. The solution includes unit tests that demonstrate and validate the functionality of the algorithm. Review the GraspSolver.cs for the implementation logic and Program.cs for usage example to understand how the components integrate and work together.
