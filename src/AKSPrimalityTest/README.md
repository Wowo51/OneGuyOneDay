# Aks Primality Test Guide

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The AKS Primality Test algorithm provides a deterministic method to check whether a number is prime by leveraging advanced concepts from number theory and polynomial arithmetic. It first verifies that the input is not a perfect power, then determines a suitable parameter based on multiplicative order properties. Finally, it performs a polynomial congruence test to conclusively decide whether the number is prime or composite.

To use the SourceCode, simply open the solution in your preferred C# development environment (such as Visual Studio), compile the project with .NET 9.0, and run the provided unit tests with Microsoft's MSTest framework. The repository is organized into separate projects for the main library and its tests, making it easy to browse, modify, and extend the implementation.
