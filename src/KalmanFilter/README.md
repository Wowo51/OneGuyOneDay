# Kalman Filter Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm that uses a series of noisy measurements to estimate the state of a dynamic system with greater accuracy than relying on any single measurement. It operates in two main phases: the prediction step, where the system’s state is projected forward based on a mathematical model, and the update step, where new measurement data is incorporated to refine this prediction and reduce uncertainty.

To use the SourceCode, begin by exploring the provided solution structure. The repository includes the core implementation of the KalmanFilter algorithm along with supporting MatrixMath utilities that handle essential linear algebra computations. Detailed unit tests illustrate various scenarios—such as state prediction with and without control inputs, updates using both accurate and perturbed measurements, and handling cases with noninvertible matrices. Customize the filter parameters (like the state transition matrix, observation matrix, and noise covariances) to tailor the algorithm for applications in sensor fusion, robotics, tracking systems, and more.
