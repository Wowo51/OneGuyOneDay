#PostmanSort Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The PostmanSort algorithm is an efficient Most-Significant-Digit (MSD) radix sort variant designed for sorting arrays of strings. It processes each string one character at a time, recursively grouping them by their character values to achieve proper order even for variable-length strings. To use the source code, reference the PostmanSort namespace in your C# project and call PostmanSorter.Sort(yourStringArray) to sort your data. The accompanying unit tests provide examples of usage and verify the algorithmâ€™s correctness.
