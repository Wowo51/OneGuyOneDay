#Subset Sum Algorithm Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

SubsetSumAlgorithm is a recursive algorithm that determines whether a subset of an array of integers sums exactly to a given target value. It works by exploring all possible combinations using recursion, including or excluding each element. The provided SourceCode demonstrates how to implement this algorithm in C# and how to use MSTest for unit testing. To use the code, include the library in your project, call the HasSubsetSum method with your array of numbers and desired target, and run the unit tests to verify functionality.
