# SieveOfSundaram Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Sieve of Sundaram algorithm is an efficient method for generating prime numbers. It works by eliminating numbers that can be written in the form i + j + 2ij for positive integers i and j. The remaining numbers, when transformed, yield all the odd primes up to a specified maximum. This approach offers a unique alternative to the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes.

To use the SourceCode:
- Clone or download the repository.
- Open the solution file in Visual Studio or any compatible C# IDE.
- Build the project targeting .NET 9.0.
- Run the console application to input a maximum number and view the list of generated primes.
- Use the included MSTest unit tests to validate the implementation.
