# CoppersmithWinogradAlgorithm Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The CoppersmithWinogradAlgorithm implements an optimized method for multiplying square matrices. It enhances the conventional cubic-time approach by precomputing row and column factors and intelligently padding matrices when their size is odd. This results in more efficient computations, particularly for large matrices.

Usage Instructions:
1. Include the library in your C# project targeting .NET 9.0.
2. Call the Multiply method from the CoppersmithWinograd class with two square matrices of equal dimensions.
3. The algorithm automatically pads matrices of odd sizes to ensure proper processing.
4. Validate the implementation using the provided unit tests that compare its output with a naive multiplication method.
5. Review the source code for further details and potential performance tuning.
