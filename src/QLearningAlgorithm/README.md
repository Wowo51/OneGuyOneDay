#QLearning Algorithm Help

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The QLearningAlgorithm implements a reinforcement learning strategy where an agent learns to take actions in an environment by maximizing cumulative reward. It employs a Q-table to store state-action values and updates these values based on received rewards, balancing exploration and exploitation. You can experiment with parameters such as learningRate, discountFactor, and explorationRate to customize the learning behavior.

To use the source code, open the solution in Visual Studio or use the .NET CLI. The QLearningAgent implementation is located in the QLearningAlgorithm project, with accompanying unit tests in the QLearningAlgorithmTest project. Build the projects and run the tests to verify functionality and see the algorithm in action.
