# Strassen Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Strassen Algorithm is a divide-and-conquer method for efficient matrix multiplication. It reduces the conventional O(n^3) complexity by partitioning matrices into sub-matrices and recursively computing products with fewer multiplications. This approach is especially beneficial for large matrices where traditional methods may be suboptimal.

To use the SourceCode, include the library in your project by referencing the provided C# classes. The main components are the Matrix and StrassenMultiplier classes, which handle matrix operations and implement the Strassen multiplication algorithm. A comprehensive set of unit tests is available to guide you through integration and to validate functionality. Simply call the Multiply method with compatible matrices to obtain the product, and refer to the unit tests for practical usage examples.
