#Stochastic Tunneling Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Stochastic Tunneling Algorithm is an optimization technique that transforms the objective function to enable tunneling through local minima. It achieves this by applying a transformation of the form T(f) = 1 - exp(-gamma * (f - bestObjective)), where gamma is a parameter that controls the tunneling effect and bestObjective is the best observed objective value. This transformation effectively smooths the objective landscape, allowing the algorithm to escape local traps and explore the search space more efficiently.

To use the SourceCode, add a reference to the StochasticTunnelingAlgorithm project in your C# solution. Instantiate the StochasticTunneling class with an appropriate gamma value, and then call its Optimize method with your custom objective function, an array representing your initial guess, and the number of iterations you wish to perform. The provided unit tests in the accompanying test project illustrate common usage patterns and verify that the algorithm performs as expected.
