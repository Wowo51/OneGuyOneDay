#PartialLeastSquares Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Partial least squares (PLS) regression is a robust statistical method designed to find the fundamental relationships between two matrices. This algorithm works by projecting both predictor (X) and response (Y) datasets into a new space where their covariance is maximized, addressing issues of multicollinearity and high-dimensionality. The provided C# implementation includes core algorithm logic, supporting multiple components and an iterative deflation process to extract latent structures from the data.

To use the source code, start by compiling the solution using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI. Familiarize yourself with the library's structure by exploring the main components: the PLSRegression class and the MatrixHelper utilities. Extensive unit tests ensure the correctness of each function. You can also refer to the test project (PartialLeastSquaresTest) to see examples of input data, prediction methods, and expected results. This comprehensive implementation is geared for both educational purposes and practical applications in predictive modeling.
