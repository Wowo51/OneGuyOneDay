# Cristian Algorithm Sync Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The CristianAlgorithmSync algorithm synchronizes a client's clock with a server's time by measuring the local time before and after obtaining the server time. By calculating half of the round-trip delay, the algorithm adjusts the server time to provide an approximation of the current time that accounts for network latency.

To use the SourceCode, simply add the CristianAlgorithmSync library to your project. You may use the provided TimeServer class or implement your own ITimeServer interface to define custom time retrieval logic. Instantiate the CristianSynchronizer and call its SynchronizeTime method to get the synchronized time. The accompanying unit tests demonstrate correct integration and usage under various simulated network delays.
