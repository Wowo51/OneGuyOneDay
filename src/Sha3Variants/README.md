# Sha3Variants Library Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Sha3Variants implements a comprehensive set of cryptographic hash algorithms based on the SHA‑3 standard. It includes implementations for SHA3‑224, SHA3‑256, SHA3‑384, and SHA3‑512 for fixed-length hashes, as well as Shake128 and Shake256 for variable-length outputs. The core algorithm leverages the Keccak sponge construction to process input data securely and efficiently.

To use the SourceCode, simply integrate the provided C# projects into your solution. The library is organized with a clear separation between the core hashing functionality, helper classes, and MSTest unit tests. Build the projects using the provided .csproj files and run the tests to verify correct functionality.
