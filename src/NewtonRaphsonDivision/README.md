# NewtonRaphsonDivision Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The NewtonRaphsonDivision algorithm employs Newton's method to iteratively compute the reciprocal of the divisor. Starting with an initial guess based on the divisor's magnitude, the algorithm refines the approximation using the iterative formula:

  xₖ₊₁ = xₖ * (2 - divisor * xₖ)

This process repeats until the difference between iterations falls below a specified tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached. The resulting reciprocal is then multiplied by the numerator to obtain the quotient.

To use the SourceCode, add the library to your project and include the NewtonRaphsonDivision namespace. The source is provided in pure C# without compiled binaries, making it easy to inspect, modify, and integrate. Unit tests are provided as examples of usage and to verify the algorithm's correctness.
