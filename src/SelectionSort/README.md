# SelectionSort Guide

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Selection sort is a straightforward, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly finding the smallest element from the unsorted portion of an array and swapping it with the first unsorted element. Although its time complexity is O(nÂ²) and may not be ideal for large datasets, its simplicity makes it an excellent choice for educational purposes and small collections.

To use the SourceCode, include the SelectionSort library in your C# project. Run the provided Program to see the algorithm in action on a sample array. Unit tests are also provided to demonstrate proper usage and verify the correctness of the implementation.
