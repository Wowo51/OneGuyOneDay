A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

GeneralProblemSolver is a pioneering algorithm originally developed as a domain-independent problem-solving tool. It works by taking an initial problem state and systematically applying a series of operators, each designed to transition the state toward a solution. The algorithm recursively explores possible state transformations, backtracking when necessary to avoid cycles and redundant paths until it either reaches the goal state or exhausts all options.

To use the SourceCode, compile the provided solution using Visual Studio or the dotnet command line interface. The solution comprises multiple projects including the implementation of key components such as Solver, Operator, and ProblemState, as well as associated unit tests. The unit tests demonstrate various scenarios—from simple linear progressions and branching paths to cyclic graphs and long chains—providing clear usage examples and guidance for integration and extension.
