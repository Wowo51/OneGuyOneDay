# ExponentiatingBySquaring Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The ExponentiatingBySquaring algorithm is used to efficiently compute large exponents by recursively squaring the base. For even exponents, the algorithm computes a^(n) as (a^(n/2))^2, and for odd exponents, it computes a^(n) as a * (a^((n-1)/2))^2. This approach minimizes the number of multiplications, making it highly efficient for large exponent values.

How to Use the Source Code:
1. Open the solution file "ExponentiatingBySquaring.sln" in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution to compile both the library and the test project.
3. Run the MSTest tests to verify the implementation.
4. Review the project files and documentation for additional details on usage and licensing.
