# Ant Colony Optimization Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a nature-inspired algorithm based on the behavior of ants searching for food. The algorithm uses simulated pheromone trails to iteratively improve upon solutions to complex optimization problems such as routing and scheduling. Ants probabilistically choose their paths based on the intensity of pheromone levels and heuristic information about path costs, allowing the colony to converge on an optimal or near-optimal solution over time.

How to use the Source Code:
- Open the solution file in Visual Studio or a compatible IDE.
- Build the project to compile the library and run unit tests.
- Review the example in Program.cs to understand how to initialize the algorithm with distance matrices and parameters.
- Modify parameters such as the number of ants, iterations, and pheromone evaporation rate to suit your specific optimization problem.
- Utilize the included unit tests to ensure that modifications do not break the functionality.
