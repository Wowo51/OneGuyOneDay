PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a widely used algorithm for transforming a password into a cryptographic key. It works by repeatedly applying a pseudorandom function (in this implementation, HMACSHA256) to the input password along with a salt value to produce a derived key. The many iterations make brute-force attacks computationally expensive, thereby enhancing security.

To use the source code, reference the Pbkdf2 library in your project and call the Pbkdf2Generator.DeriveKey method. Provide your password, a salt, the desired iteration count, and key length to obtain a secure derived key as a byte array. The accompanying unit tests in the Pbkdf2Test project demonstrate various usage scenarios and validate edge cases.
