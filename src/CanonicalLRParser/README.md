# Canonical LR Parser Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Canonical LR Parser algorithm builds a comprehensive collection of LR(0) items through grammar augmentation, closure, and goto operations. It begins by augmenting the grammar with a new start symbol and computing the closure of the initial production. Subsequent states are generated by shifting the dot over symbols and merging equivalent items to create a canonical collection. The algorithm then constructs robust Action and Goto tables using computed FIRST and FOLLOW sets, ensuring correct handling of shift, reduce, and accept actions.

To use the SourceCode, incorporate the CanonicalLRParser project into your solution and reference it in your application or test projects. The provided unit tests demonstrate how to instantiate the parser, supply tokenized input, and verify parsing outcomes. Detailed logging and clear code structure make it easy to customize the parser for your specific grammar and debugging needs.
