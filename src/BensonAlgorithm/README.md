# BensonAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

BensonAlgorithm is an advanced algorithm for solving linear vector optimization problems. It generates weight vectors for aggregating multiple objectives and employs a simplex solver to find Pareto optimal solutions. The algorithm is designed to handle both bounded and unbounded problems efficiently, ensuring a robust solution process.

How to Use the Source Code:
- Open the BensonAlgorithm.sln solution in Visual Studio or use the .NET CLI.
- Build the solution to compile the library and the test projects.
- Run the unit tests in the BensonAlgorithmTest project to verify correct functionality.
- Review the source files in the Algorithms folder for understanding the implementation details of the BensonSolver and SimplexSolver.
- Customize input parameters within the LinearVectorOptimizationProblem for experimenting with different optimization scenarios.
