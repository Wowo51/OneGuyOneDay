# PaxosAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

PaxosAlgorithm is a consensus algorithm designed for distributed systems. It coordinates Proposers, Acceptors, and Learners to ensure that a single value is agreed upon even in the presence of failures. The Proposer initiates a proposal, Acceptors decide whether to accept or reject it based on proposal numbers, and the Learner determines the agreed-upon value from the responses.

Usage:
1. Instantiate a list of Acceptors.
2. Create a Proposer by providing a proposal number, a value, and the list of Acceptors.
3. Call RunProposal on the Proposer to initiate the consensus process.
4. Use the Learner to gather responses and determine the consensus value.
5. Run the included unit tests to verify functionality.

To use the SourceCode, open the provided solution (PaxosAlgorithm.sln) in Visual Studio. The code is organized into clear modules for the core algorithm and its tests. Build the projects, run the tests, and integrate the library into your project as needed.
