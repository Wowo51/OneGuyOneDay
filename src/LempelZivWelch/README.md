#LempelZivWelch

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm is a lossless data compression technique that builds a dictionary of input sequences and replaces repeated occurrences with references. This implementation in C# provides two primary functions:
- Compress: Takes an input string and returns a list of integers representing the compressed data.
- Decompress: Takes the list of integers and reconstructs the original string.

To use the SourceCode, add the library to your C# project, reference the Lzw class, and call Compress to encode data and Decompress to decode it. Unit tests are provided using Microsoft's testing framework to ensure correctness and serve as usage examples.
