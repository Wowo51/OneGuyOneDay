# Cocktail Shaker Sort Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Cocktail Shaker Sort algorithm, also known as bidirectional bubble sort, works by iteratively passing through the list in both directions. In the forward pass, it bubbles up the largest element to the end, while in the backward pass, it moves the smallest element to the beginning. This dual process continues until no swaps are required, ensuring that the entire array is sorted.

To use the SourceCode, include the library in your C# project, invoke the static method CocktailSorter.CocktailShakerSort with your array, and run the accompanying MSTest unit tests to validate functionality. The SourceCode is modular, well-commented, and free to use under the MIT License.
