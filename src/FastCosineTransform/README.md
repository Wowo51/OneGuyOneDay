# Fast Cosine Transform Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Fast Cosine Transform algorithm efficiently computes the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of an input array by leveraging fast Fourier transform techniques when the input size is a power-of-two, or using conventional discrete Fourier transform methods otherwise. This implementation includes both DCT and FFT algorithms written in C#, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy for various input sizes. Use the provided source code as a library in your own C# projects. To integrate the code, reference the appropriate project files (e.g., FastCosineTransform.csproj) and run the accompanying MSTest unit tests to verify correctness. The source includes examples in unit tests demonstrating handling of null, empty, single element, known DCT patterns, and large input arrays.
