# NearestNeighborSearchLibrary

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The NearestNeighborSearch algorithm is a robust solution for identifying the nearest data points within a dataset relative to a target point. It supports both single nearest neighbor identification and retrieving the k-nearest neighbors via Euclidean distance calculations.

How to Use the Library:
1. Add the NearestNeighborSearch project to your solution.
2. Instantiate the NearestNeighborSearchAlgorithm class from the library.
3. For a single nearest neighbor search, call the FindNearestNeighbor() method with your dataset and target point.
4. For multiple nearest neighbor searches, call the FindKNearestNeighbors() method with the dataset, target point, and the number of neighbors (k).
5. Explore the SourceCode section in the repository to review project files, unit tests, and sample usage. These examples serve as references for integrating the algorithm into your own projects.
