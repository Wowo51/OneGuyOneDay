# HammingDistance

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The HammingDistance algorithm computes the number of positions at which the corresponding characters of two strings differ. If the strings are of unequal length or if one is null, the method returns -1 to indicate that the distance cannot be computed. This straightforward implementation is provided as a static method in the HammingDistanceCalculator class.

Using the SourceCode:
- Compile the HammingDistance project targeting .NET 9.0.
- Run the accompanying MSTest unit tests in the HammingDistanceTest project to verify functionality.
- Integrate the library into your own projects by referencing the HammingDistance project.
