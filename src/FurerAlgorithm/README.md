#Furer Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

FurerAlgorithm is a highly optimized algorithm for multiplying large integers. It converts integers into arrays of digits using a specific base (usually 10000), applies a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to perform convolution, and then converts the result back into an integer. This approach leverages the efficiency of FFT to perform large integer multiplication with lower asymptotic computational complexity than conventional methods.

To use the source code, open the solution file (FurerAlgorithm.sln) in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment. The library is pure C# with no external dependencies aside from MSTest for unit testing. Compile the project and run the provided unit tests to verify functionality. Use the FurerMultiplier.Multiply method to perform multiplication operations, and refer to the code comments for detailed implementation insights.
