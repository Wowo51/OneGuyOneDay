# Incremental Delta Encoding

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

Incremental Delta Encoding is an algorithm that optimizes the storage of sequences of strings by encoding only the differences between successive entries. The first string is stored in full, and each subsequent string is represented by the length of its common prefix with the previous string followed by the differing suffix. This reduces redundancy and minimizes storage requirements.

Usage:
- To encode an array of strings, call DeltaEncoder.Encode, which returns an array where the first element remains unaltered and each subsequent element is encoded as "prefixLength:suffix".
- To decode an encoded array back to its original form, use DeltaEncoder.Decode.
- The SourceCode provided demonstrates the implementation along with unit tests using MSTest. Simply integrate the library into your project and invoke these static methods as needed.
