# GenerationalGarbageCollector Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The GenerationalGarbageCollector algorithm is designed based on the observation that most objects become unreachable quickly. Newly created objects are allocated in Generation 0. During garbage collection, objects that are still in use are promoted to older generations (Generation 1 and Generation 2) to reduce the frequency of collections in these areas. This strategy optimizes performance by focusing collection efforts on short-lived objects while preserving longer-lived ones.

To use the SourceCode, open the provided solution in Visual Studio or use the .NET CLI. The project includes comprehensive unit tests using MSTest to verify correctness and functionality. Build the solution, run the tests, and then integrate the GenerationalGarbageCollector library into your own applications as needed.
