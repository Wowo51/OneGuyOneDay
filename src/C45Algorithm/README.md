# C45Algorithm Library Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The C45Algorithm algorithm implements a decision tree induction method that extends the classic ID3 algorithm with improvements such as handling continuous attributes through thresholding and using gain ratio as a splitting criterion. This library allows you to efficiently build decision trees for classification tasks on both continuous and discrete datasets.

Usage Instructions:
- Compile the solution using Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI.
- Run the accompanying MSTest unit tests to verify functionality.
- Explore the SourceCode files for project setup and algorithm implementation.
- Refer to the license file and documentation for further details.
