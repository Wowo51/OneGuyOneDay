# KMeansPlusPlus Library Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The KMeansPlusPlus algorithm improves the traditional k-means clustering algorithm by using a smart centroid initialization process. Initially, the first centroid is chosen at random, and subsequent centroids are selected based on a probability distribution weighted by the squared distance to the nearest chosen centroid. This method helps ensure that the centroids are well-separated, which can lead to faster convergence and improved clustering quality.

To use the source code, include the KMeansPlusPlus library in your C# project. Instantiate the KMeansPlusPlusAlgorithm class and call its Fit method with your dataset and desired number of clusters. The solution comes with comprehensive unit tests to verify functionality. Simply build the solution with Visual Studio or any .NET-compatible build tool and run the tests to see the algorithm in action.
