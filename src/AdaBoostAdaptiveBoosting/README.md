# AdaBoost Adaptive Boosting Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

AdaBoost Adaptive Boosting is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple weak learners, typically decision stumps, to perform binary classification. It works by iteratively adjusting the weights of training samples, focusing more on those that are misclassified. With each iteration, a new weak learner is added and assigned a weight based on its accuracy, and the final prediction is determined by a weighted majority vote.

To use the SourceCode, compile the C# library using the .NET SDK and run the included unit tests with Microsoft's testing framework. You can integrate the library into your project to utilize its AdaBoost implementation for tasks such as pattern recognition or binary classification.
