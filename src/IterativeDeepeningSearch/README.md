# Iterative Deepening Search Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Iterative Deepening Search (IDDFS) algorithm combines the low memory footprint of depth-first search with the optimality of breadth-first search. It works by performing a series of depth-limited searches, gradually increasing the depth limit until the goal is found. This approach is especially useful when the depth of the solution is unknown and when memory resources are limited.

To use the SourceCode, simply compile the project using your preferred .NET development environment, such as Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI. The solution is self-contained in pure C# and includes a comprehensive set of unit tests that demonstrate common usage scenarios for the algorithm.
