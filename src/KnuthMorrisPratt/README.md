# KnuthMorrisPratt Algorithm Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a powerful substring search technique that improves performance by precomputing a longest prefix suffix (LPS) array. This array helps the algorithm avoid re-checking characters that have already been matched, allowing for faster searches even in large texts.

How to Use the Source Code:
1. Add the KnuthMorrisPratt project to your solution.
2. Reference the project in your application.
3. Call the KMPAlgorithm.Search method with the text and pattern you wish to search.
4. Run the provided unit tests to verify correct behavior.
5. Customize and extend the library as needed.
