# ShellSort Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

ShellSort is an efficient sorting algorithm that improves upon insertion sort by allowing the exchange of items that are far apart. It starts by sorting elements far apart from each other and progressively reduces the gap between elements to be compared. This approach helps to reduce the total number of swaps required and can significantly improve performance for larger arrays.

To use the SourceCode provided in this project, simply include the ShellSorter class in your C# project. The library includes methods to sort arrays using either a default comparer or a custom comparer. Additionally, comprehensive unit tests are provided using MSTest, ensuring reliability and ease of integration. Simply compile the solution and run the tests using your preferred .NET test runner.
