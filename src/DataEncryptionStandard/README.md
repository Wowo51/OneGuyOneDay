#Data Encryption Standard Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

DataEncryptionStandard is a C# implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. This library provides two main methods: Encrypt and Decrypt. The Encrypt method takes a byte array, an 8-byte key, and an 8-byte initialization vector (IV), and returns the encrypted byte array. The Decrypt method performs the reverse operation. The code leverages the .NET DES cryptographic provider.

To use the SourceCode, compile the solution using the .NET CLI or Visual Studio, then reference the DataEncryptionStandard project in your application. The library includes comprehensive unit tests demonstrating typical use cases, error handling, and validation scenarios. The included tests use MSTest for testing. Use the sample Program.cs as a guide for how to integrate encryption and decryption functionality in your application.
