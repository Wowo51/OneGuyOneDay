# BaileyBorweinPlouffe Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe (BBP) algorithm is a spigot algorithm that allows the direct extraction of binary or hexadecimal digits of π without the need to compute all preceding digits. It leverages mathematical series and modular arithmetic to calculate the nth digit independently. To use the source code, compile the project using .NET 9.0 and run the executable; you will be prompted to enter the position of the binary digit of π you wish to retrieve. Comprehensive unit tests are provided to verify the functionality of both the algorithm and its components.
