# FordFulkersonAlgorithm Help

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

FordFulkersonAlgorithm implements the classic Ford-Fulkerson method to compute the maximum flow in a flow network. It works by repeatedly finding an augmenting path from the source to the sink using depth-first search (DFS) and then pushing additional flow along that path until no more augmenting paths exist.

How to use the SourceCode:
1. Clone the repository containing the SourceCode.
2. Open the solution file (FordFulkersonAlgorithm.sln) in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution targeting .NET 9.0.
4. Run the provided unit tests using MSTest to verify the implementation.
5. Integrate the compiled library into your project as needed.
