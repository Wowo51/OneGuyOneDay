# BestBinFirst Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

BestBinFirst is a heuristic algorithm designed to efficiently solve the nearest neighbor search problem in high-dimensional spaces. It constructs a kd-tree from a set of points and employs a best-first search strategy to explore the tree. The algorithm prioritizes nodes that are most likely to contain the nearest neighbor by computing bounding distances, often yielding faster approximate solutions compared to exhaustive searches.

To use the source code, add the project to your solution or reference the compiled assembly in your C# project. The source is organized into clearly defined classes such as BestBinFirstSearch, KdTree, and Point. Comprehensive unit tests using Microsoft's testing tools are provided to help validate the library's behavior. Modify and integrate the library as needed for efficient nearest neighbor computations in your applications.
