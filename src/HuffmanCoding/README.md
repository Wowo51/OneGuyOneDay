## Help: Huffman Coding Algorithm

The Huffman Coding algorithm is used for lossless data compression. It works by analyzing the frequency of each character in a given input and constructing a binary tree—the Huffman Tree—where each leaf node represents a character. Lower frequency characters are placed deeper in the tree, leading to longer binary codes, while higher frequency characters reside closer to the root with shorter codes. This process produces an optimal prefix code that minimizes the total number of bits used to represent the input.

To use the SourceCode provided:
1. Build the Huffman Tree using the HuffmanTree.BuildTree method with your input string.
2. Compress your text by calling the Compress method, which leverages the codes generated from the Huffman Tree.
3. Decompress the resulting binary string back into text using the Decompress method.
4. The implementation is split across well-organized C# files (HuffmanCoding.cs, HuffmanTree.cs, Program.cs) and is accompanied by unit tests (HuffmanCodingTests.cs) to verify functionality.
5. Simply open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred .NET environment, build the project, and run the tests to validate the implementation.
