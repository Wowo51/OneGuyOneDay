# Deflate Compression Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Deflate algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm that combines LZ77 and Huffman coding to reduce file sizes without losing data. It works by identifying repeated sequences in the input and encoding them with shorter, efficient representations. 

To use the SourceCode, compile the provided C# project targeting .NET 9.0. The library exposes two primary methods: Compress and Decompress, enabling you to easily compress byte arrays and decompress them back to their original form. Comprehensive unit tests are included to validate functionality and ensure reliability in a production environment.
