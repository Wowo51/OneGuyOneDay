# InsertionSort Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Insertion Sort algorithm is a simple sorting technique that builds a sorted array one element at a time. It works by iterating through the list and inserting each element into its proper place within the already sorted portion. This method is particularly efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets.

How to use the SourceCode:
1. Open the solution file (InsertionSort.sln) in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
2. Build the solution to compile the library and run the unit tests.
3. Examine the InsertionSorter.Sort method in the source code for implementation details.
4. Reference the compiled library in your project to sort your collections using this algorithm.
