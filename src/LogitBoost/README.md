# LogitBoost Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

LogitBoost is a machine learning algorithm that improves classification performance by sequentially fitting an ensemble of weak learners, typically decision stumps, to iteratively minimize the logistic loss. In each iteration, the algorithm computes pseudo-residuals and adapts weights to focus on challenging examples, thereby refining its predictions. The model outputs class probabilities, which can then be converted into binary predictions through a threshold.

To use the source code, add the library to your C# project, instantiate the LogitBoostAlgorithm class, and invoke the Fit method with your training dataset. After training, use PredictProbability to obtain class probabilities or Predict to get binary outcomes. The source code is accompanied by comprehensive unit tests, ensuring reliability and ease of integration into your projects.
