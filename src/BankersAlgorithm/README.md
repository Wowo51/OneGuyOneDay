# BankersAlgorithm Implementation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Bankers Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm that ensures system safety by checking if a safe sequence exists whereby processes can complete without causing a deadlock. It calculates each process’s resource needs and iteratively examines whether available resources can satisfy at least one process’s requirements. When a process completes, its allocated resources are returned to the available pool, potentially allowing other processes to finish.

To use the SourceCode, compile the C# library using the .NET framework and run the accompanying MSTest unit tests to verify the safe sequence computation. The solution also includes a sample console application for a practical demonstration. Modify resource parameters and process details as needed to test various scenarios.
