# RandomForest Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

RandomForest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to obtain a more accurate and stable prediction. To use this library, include the provided C# source files in your project. The library is self-contained, relying only on Microsoft's unit testing framework. You can instantiate the RandomForest class, train it with your training data (a list of DataPoint objects), and use it to make predictions by calling the Predict method. The source code is organized into several parts, including the decision tree implementation, data point definition, and test cases. This modular design allows easy integration and customization in machine learning projects.
