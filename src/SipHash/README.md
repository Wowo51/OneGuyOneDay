# SipHash Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The SipHash algorithm is a fast cryptographic hash function designed for short inputs, providing strong security with minimal performance overhead. It utilizes a pair of 64-bit keys to compute a 64-bit hash value reliably. This implementation uses two overloads of the ComputeHash method for convenience.

To use the SourceCode, simply reference the SipHasher class in your project and invoke ComputeHash on your byte array data with the appropriate keys. Unit tests are included to demonstrate usage and to verify hash consistency and correctness.
