A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Sequitur Algorithm is a lossless compression algorithm that transforms an input string into a hierarchical grammar representation by replacing repeated adjacent pairs with nonterminal symbols. This algorithm can efficiently compress repetitive text and generate a compact grammar.

To use the SourceCode, compile the SequiturAlgorithm project and reference it in your application. The provided Program.cs demonstrates how to prompt for input, compress the string using the algorithm, and display the resulting grammar. Additionally, comprehensive unit tests are included to verify functionality, ensuring reliability and ease of integration in any C# project.
