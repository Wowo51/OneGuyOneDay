# Velvet Algorithm Suite Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The VelvetAlgorithmSuite algorithm leverages de Bruijn graph techniques to assemble genomic sequences efficiently. It breaks input sequences into overlapping kmers, constructs a de Bruijn graph that captures the relationships between these kmers, and then determines an Eulerian path that reconstructs the original sequence. This approach is particularly effective for handling short-read genomic data.

How to Use:
1. Add a reference to the VelvetAlgorithmSuite library in your C# project.
2. Use the DeBruijnGraph class to build a graph from your sequence data.
3. Utilize the SequenceAssembler class to reconstruct the full sequence from overlapping reads.
4. Run the unit tests provided (using MSTest) to validate the assembly and ensure proper integration.

This source code is accompanied by comprehensive test cases that demonstrate its functionality and performance.
