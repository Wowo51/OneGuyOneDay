# BoyerMooreHorspoolAlgorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

BoyerMooreHorspool is an efficient substring search algorithm that uses a simplified version of the classic Boyer-Moore method. By pre-processing the search pattern to build a shift table, the algorithm can skip portions of the input text that do not match the pattern, leading to faster average-case performance.

To use the SourceCode, open the provided solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE. The repository is organized into a library project containing the algorithm implementation and a separate test project. Run the tests using the 'dotnet test' command to verify correctness before integrating the library into your own projects.
