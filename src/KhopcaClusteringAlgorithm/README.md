#KhopcaClusteringAlgorithm Guide

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The KHOPCA Clustering Algorithm is a local clustering algorithm that elects cluster heads based on node weights and local neighbor information. In its first phase, each node compares its own weight against those of its immediate neighbors and designates itself as the cluster head if it holds the highest weight. In the second phase, the best candidate is propagated over a configurable number of hops (K) to achieve consensus across the network. This iterative approach allows the algorithm to adapt effectively in both static and mobile environments.

To use the SourceCode, open the provided solution in Visual Studio or use the dotnet CLI. The repository is organized into separate projects for the core algorithm and its unit tests. Run the tests to verify functionality, and then integrate or modify the algorithm as needed for your specific network simulation or clustering requirements.
