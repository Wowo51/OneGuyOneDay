# SchreierSimsAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

SchreierSimsAlgorithm is an algorithm for computing a base and strong generating set (BSGS) for a permutation group. It works by exploring the closure of the group generated by a set of permutations and then identifying a base—a sequence of points—and the corresponding strong generators that stabilize those points. The algorithm systematically reduces the group's complexity by computing stabilizers iteratively until only the identity remains.

To use the SourceCode, compile the library in a .NET environment as demonstrated in the provided projects. The Program.cs file contains an example showing how to generate permutations, invoke the ComputeBSGS method, and display the resulting base points and strong generators. Additionally, the unit tests serve as further usage examples and validation of the algorithm's correctness. Refer to the project files for insights on structure and dependencies.
