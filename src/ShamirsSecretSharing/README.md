# ShamirsSecretSharing Library Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic algorithm used to split a secret into multiple parts, called shares. The algorithm ensures that a sufficient number of shares, when combined, can reconstruct the original secret, while fewer shares reveal nothing about it. This implementation in C# provides methods to split a secret into shares and to combine shares to recover the secret.

To use the SourceCode, compile the provided C# project in a .NET environment. The solution includes comprehensive unit tests using Microsoft's MSTest framework. Open the solution in Visual Studio, build the project, and run the tests to verify the functionality.
