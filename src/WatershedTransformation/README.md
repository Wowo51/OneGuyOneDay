# Watershed Transformation Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Watershed Transformation algorithm is an image segmentation technique based on the concept of flooding a topographical surface. By treating pixel intensity values as elevations, the algorithm "floods" the image to identify distinct catchment basins that represent different segments. It processes the image by sorting pixels by intensity and then iteratively labeling each pixel according to its neighbors, effectively partitioning the image into meaningful regions.

To use the SourceCode, integrate the WatershedTransformation library into your C# project. Reference its namespace and call the SegmentImage method from the WatershedSegmenter class to segment your image data. The library comes fully unit tested with MSTest, and you can refer to the associated test project for practical usage examples and further guidance.
