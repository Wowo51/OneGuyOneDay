# VincentysFormulae Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Vincenty's Formulae is an iterative algorithm for computing the geodesic distance between two latitude/longitude points on an ellipsoidal model of the Earth. This method employs the WGS-84 ellipsoid parameters and iteratively refines the distance calculation for high accuracy.

To use the SourceCode, add the provided C# project into your solution. The main functionality is accessed via the VincentyCalculator class, which exposes the CalculateDistance method. Unit tests have been included with MSTest to demonstrate usage and validate results. You can run these tests using Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI to confirm the algorithm's correctness before integrating it into your application.
