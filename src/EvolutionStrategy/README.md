# EvolutionStrategy Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

EvolutionStrategy is an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes real-valued parameters through mutation and selection. It starts with a randomly generated population of individuals, each encoded as a set of parameters. In each generation, the algorithm creates offspring by applying Gaussian mutations and replaces parents with offspring if an improved fitness is observed. The code is implemented in C# and is designed with simplicity and clarity, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend. To use the source code, compile the provided solution using your preferred .NET environment. You can run the main application to execute the algorithm or use the included unit tests to validate its functionality. This approach provides a robust framework for solving optimization problems with continuous parameters.
