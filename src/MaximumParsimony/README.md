# Maximum Parsimony Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Maximum Parsimony algorithm is designed to infer phylogenetic trees by minimizing the total number of evolutionary changes. It leverages Fitch's method to calculate the parsimony cost across tree configurations, ensuring that the selected tree requires the fewest mutational events to explain the observed sequence data.

To use the SourceCode, simply reference the MaximumParsimony library in your C# project. The library is self-contained with no external dependencies aside from Microsoftâ€™s unit testing framework. Run the provided unit tests to verify that the implementation works correctly, and integrate the library into your workflow for efficient phylogenetic analysis.
