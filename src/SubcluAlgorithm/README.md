#SubcluAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

SubcluAlgorithm is a subspace clustering algorithm implemented in C#. It processes datasets to identify clusters across various subspaces of the feature dimensions using a DBSCAN-like approach. The algorithm evaluates all possible combinations of dimensions (subspaces) and applies density-based clustering (utilizing epsilon and minimum points parameters) within each subspace.

The provided SourceCode includes the implementation in the Subclu class along with corresponding unit tests in the SubcluAlgorithmTest project. To use this SourceCode, compile the projects in Visual Studio or using the dotnet CLI, and run the unit tests to verify functionality.
