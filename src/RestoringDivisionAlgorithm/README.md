A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

RestoringDivisionAlgorithm is a C# library that implements the restoring division algorithm. It provides a method to perform division on unsigned integers and returns the quotient and remainder. The algorithm simulates the manual process of division by shifting bits, subtracting the divisor, and conditionally restoring the remainder if a subtraction results in a negative value.

To use the SourceCode, simply incorporate the provided C# files into your project. The solution consists of a main library that implements the algorithm and a separate test project that uses MSTest to validate all functionality. Build the projects with .NET 9.0 and run the tests with the dotnet test command or within Visual Studio. This setup ensures that the algorithm works correctly under various conditions including division by zero and maximum value operations.
