# Chudnovsky Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Chudnovsky Algorithm is an efficient method for calculating digits of π using a rapidly convergent series discovered by the Chudnovsky brothers. The algorithm employs binary splitting to accelerate the computation process, breaking the calculation into smaller pieces for enhanced performance. The source code is organized into a pure C# library along with accompanying unit tests. To use the code, reference the library project in your C# solution and call the CalculatePi method with the desired number of digits. The unit tests serve both as usage examples and as a verification of the algorithm’s accuracy.
