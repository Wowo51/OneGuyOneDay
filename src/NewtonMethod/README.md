A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

NewtonMethod is an iterative numerical algorithm designed to find successively improved approximations to the roots of a real-valued function. When applied to optimization, it uses the function's gradient and Hessian matrix to determine the direction and magnitude of update steps, converging rapidly if the function is well-behaved. The source code includes a complete implementation of this algorithm, with components such as NewtonOptimizer for performing the iterative updates, and helper classes like VectorUtil and MatrixUtil to manage the underlying mathematical operations.

To use the SourceCode, compile the project with .NET 9.0 and run the accompanying unit tests via MSTest to verify functionality. The in-code documentation further explains each component of the algorithm, making it easy to understand and extend as needed.
