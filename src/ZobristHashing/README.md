# Zobrist Hashing Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

The Zobrist Hashing algorithm is an efficient technique used in board games and similar applications to quickly generate a unique hash representing a board state. It works by precomputing a table of random numbers for every board position and every possible piece type. When a piece is added, removed, or moved, the hash is updated by XOR-ing the corresponding random values, allowing for rapid incremental updates rather than recomputing the entire board hash from scratch. This approach is especially useful in game engines' transposition tables to detect repeated states and optimize search algorithms.

To use the SourceCode:
1. Add the project to your solution and reference it.
2. Create an instance of the ZobristHasher class by providing the board dimensions and the number of piece types.
3. Represent your game board as a two-dimensional integer array where each value indicates a piece type.
4. Call the ComputeHash method to obtain a hash value for the current board state.
5. Review the included unit tests for usage examples and to validate hash consistency and edge-case handling.
