# LaxWendroff Method Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Lax–Wendroff method is a finite difference scheme for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations. It is second-order accurate in both space and time. This algorithm employs a predictor-corrector mechanism to improve accuracy and stability. The provided source code includes an implementation of the Lax–Wendroff solver and comprehensive unit tests to validate its performance.

To use the source code, compile the solution in a .NET 9.0 environment. Run the unit tests to verify functionality, and execute the main program to observe the simulation results. Adjust simulation parameters such as grid size, time step, and wave speed as needed for your specific application.
