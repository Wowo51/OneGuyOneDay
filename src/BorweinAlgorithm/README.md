# Borwein Algorithm Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Borwein's algorithm is an iterative method that rapidly converges to an approximation of 1/Ï€. It refines an initial guess using a sequence of adjustments based on arithmetic-geometric mean calculations. With each iteration, the approximation becomes increasingly accurate, making it ideal for high-precision computations.

To use the SourceCode, include the BorweinAlgorithm project in your solution and reference the static class BorweinCalculator. The CalculateReciprocalPi method accepts a non-negative iteration count (with negative values defaulting to zero), and comprehensive unit tests demonstrate its usage and convergence properties.
