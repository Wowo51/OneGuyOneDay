# BoruvkaAlgorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Boruvka's Algorithm is a classic greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph. It works by starting with each vertex as a separate tree and iteratively merging trees by selecting the smallest edge connecting any two trees. The algorithm continues until only one spanning tree remains for each connected component.

How to use the SourceCode:
- Open the solution file (BoruvkasAlgorithm.sln) in Microsoft Visual Studio or use the .NET CLI.
- Build the project to compile the library and run unit tests.
- Review the unit tests in BoruvkasAlgorithmTest.cs for usage examples.
- Explore the C# implementation in the library to understand the union-find mechanism and edge selection process.
