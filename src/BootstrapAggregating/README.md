# Bootstrap Aggregating Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) is an ensemble learning technique that improves the stability and accuracy of statistical models by averaging predictions from multiple predictors. The algorithm works by training each predictor on a randomly drawn subset of the original data (with replacement) and then combining their outputs to produce a final, more robust prediction. This method helps to reduce variance and avoid overfitting.

Usage:
- Compile the solution provided in the source code.
- Run the unit tests to verify functionality.
- Utilize the BootstrapAggregator class by providing a list of predictors that implement the IPredictor interface.
- Customize or replace predictors as necessary to suit your specific application.
