# SukhotinsAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Sukhotin's Algorithm is a statistical method for classifying characters in text as vowels or consonants based on adjacency frequency analysis. It constructs an adjacency matrix from the input text and iteratively refines a set of vowel characters by identifying those with strong associations. The algorithm is designed to work even when traditional vowel definitions are ambiguous.

How to use the SourceCode:
To utilize the algorithm, reference the provided C# library in your project. Call the static method SukhotinsAlgorithm.Classify(string text) to process your input and receive a ClassificationResult object containing lists of vowels and consonants. The SourceCode includes comprehensive unit tests demonstrating typical usage scenarios. Run these tests to verify functionality before integrating the library into your application.
