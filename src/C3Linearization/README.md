# C3 Linearization Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

## Help: About C3 Linearization

The C3 Linearization algorithm is used to determine a consistent and predictable method resolution order for classes in a multiple inheritance hierarchy. It works by recursively merging the linearizations of parent classes, ensuring that local precedence is maintained while resolving conflicts inherent in multiple inheritance.

To use the source code, compile the project using the .NET 9.0 SDK. The repository includes Visual Studio solution files and project configurations, along with unit tests written using Microsoft's MSTest framework. Build the solution and run the tests to validate that the implementation works as expected before integrating the library into your project.
