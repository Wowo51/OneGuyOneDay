# Random Hill Climb Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The RandomHillClimb algorithm is a stochastic optimization method that repeatedly applies hill climbing from various random starting points to overcome local optima. It starts with a random initial solution and iteratively improves it by examining neighboring solutions generated by a user-defined neighbor generator. If a neighbor offers a better objective value, the algorithm moves to it; otherwise, it restarts the process from another random initial solution. This approach increases the chance of finding the global optimum in complex solution spaces.

How to Use the SourceCode:
- The SourceCode section contains all necessary files for the project including the C# class library implementing the RandomHillClimb algorithm, accompanying project files, and unit tests using Microsoft's MSTest framework.
- To integrate the algorithm into your project, reference the RandomHillClimb library in your solution, customize the random state generator, neighbor generator, and objective function to suit your problem, and then build and run the tests.
- The project is organized to easily allow modifications and extensions, so you can adapt the algorithm for different optimization challenges.
