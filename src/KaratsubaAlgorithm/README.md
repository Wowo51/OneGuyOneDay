#Karatsuba Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Karatsuba algorithm is an efficient multiplication algorithm that uses recursive splitting of numbers to achieve faster multiplication than the conventional approach. This library provides a pure C# implementation of the algorithm. To use the SourceCode, simply reference the KaratsubaAlgorithm project in your solution and call the Multiply method from the KaratsubaMultiplier class with two BigInteger arguments. The provided unit tests cover a variety of cases, including small, large, and negative numbers. In addition, the repository includes project files, licensing information, and build logs that demonstrate the complete development and testing process.
