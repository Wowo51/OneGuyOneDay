# SchenstedAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

SchenstedAlgorithm is a combinatorial algorithm that constructs a pair of Young tableaux from a permutation. It uses a "bumping" process whereby each element from an input sequence is inserted into an evolving Young tableau, eventually producing two tableaux that capture the inherent structure of the permutation. This approach is fundamental in combinatorics and finds application in analyzing longest increasing subsequences.

To use the SourceCode, integrate the provided C# library into your project targeting .NET 9.0. The solution comes with comprehensive unit tests built with MSTest to ensure the algorithm functions as expected. Simply build the solution and run the tests, or reference the compiled library in your own application. The code is modular and designed for easy customization.
