# Mae1 Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Mae1 algorithm is a streamlined computational framework developed in C#. It emphasizes clarity, modular design, and rigorous unit testing to ensure reliable performance. The algorithm is designed to solve problems efficiently by breaking tasks into manageable components and by using a minimalistic approach to dependencies.

To use the SourceCode, begin by cloning the repository. Open the Mae1.sln solution file in Visual Studio or via the dotnet CLI. Build the project and run the provided unit tests in the Mae1Test project to verify functionality. This process ensures the integrity of the library and confirms that the algorithm performs as expected.
