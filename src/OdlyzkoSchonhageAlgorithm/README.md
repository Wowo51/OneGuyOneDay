# OdlyzkoSchonhageAlgorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The OdlyzkoSchonhageAlgorithm algorithm efficiently computes nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function by employing advanced numerical techniques including parallel sampling and a refined bisection method. It features both an efficient high-performance approach and a compatibility method to accommodate different use cases. The algorithm is designed to accurately pinpoint zeros on the critical line, making it a valuable tool in analytic number theory.

To use the SourceCode, open the provided solution file in your preferred .NET IDE (such as Visual Studio), build the project, and run the included MSTest unit tests to verify correctness. The solution is organized into multiple projects, including the main library and test projects, ensuring modularity and ease of integration into larger applications.
