# Raft Algorithm Guide

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The RaftAlgorithm implements a distributed consensus protocol designed for managing replicated logs and leader election in a fault-tolerant manner. It is built as a pure C# library with clean separation of concerns. Key classes include RaftCluster, RaftNode, and RaftLogEntry. To use this source code, compile the project using .NET 9.0 or later. The solution includes a Visual Studio project file (.sln) and a set of unit tests using MSTest. Run the tests using the dotnet test command or through Visual Studio's test runner to validate functionality and gain deeper insights into how leader election and log replication are handled.
