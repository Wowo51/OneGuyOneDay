# DepthFirstSearch Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The DepthFirstSearch algorithm implemented in this library is a recursive graph traversal technique that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is designed to work with generic data types, ensuring each node is visited only once. The source code demonstrates how to construct a graph, add edges, and invoke the DFS method from the DepthFirstSearchAlgorithm class to obtain a depth-first traversal order.

To use the source code, include the DepthFirstSearch library in your project. Create a graph instance, add edges between vertices, and then call the DFS method with a starting vertex. The project is structured as a pure C# library with comprehensive MSTest unit tests. You can compile the code using .NET 9.0 and run the tests to validate its functionality.
