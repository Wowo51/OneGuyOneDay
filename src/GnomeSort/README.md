# GnomeSort Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

GnomeSort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that works by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Inspired by the movements of a garden gnome rearranging items, it gradually moves each element into its proper position. Although it is not the most efficient method for large datasets, its simplicity makes it an excellent educational tool.

Usage Instructions:
1. Compile the C# library project using the .NET SDK.
2. Review the Program.cs file for a practical example of sorting an array.
3. Run the accompanying unit tests using Visual Studio or the dotnet test command to verify the algorithmâ€™s functionality.
4. Examine the source code to understand the design and implementation details of the algorithm.
