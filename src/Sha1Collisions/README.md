#Sha1Collisions

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Sha1Collisions implements the SHA‑1 hashing algorithm, providing a straightforward example of computing SHA‑1 hashes from strings. Note that SHA‑1 is considered insecure for cryptographic purposes due to known collision vulnerabilities. This library is ideal for educational purposes and for non-security-critical applications where a simple hash function is needed.

To use the SourceCode, download or clone the repository. Open the solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred .NET development environment, build the projects, and run the included unit tests to verify functionality.
