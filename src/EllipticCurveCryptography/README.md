# EllipticCurveCryptography Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The EllipticCurveCryptography algorithm implements elliptic curve operations including point addition, point doubling, and scalar multiplication over finite fields. It leverages modular arithmetic to perform secure key generation and encryption routines based on elliptic curve properties. To use the source code, simply include the library in your C# project, create an instance of the EllipticCurve class with appropriate parameters (coefficients a, b, and a prime modulus), and then call the available methods in the ECCryptography class (Add, Double, Multiply) to perform cryptographic computations. Comprehensive unit tests are provided to validate each operation and ensure correctness.
