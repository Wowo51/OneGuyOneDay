# RadialBasisNetwork Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

RadialBasisNetwork is an algorithm based on radial basis functions. It computes outputs by measuring the distance between the input and predefined centers and then applying an exponential decay function powered by a beta parameter. The resulting activations are weighted and summed to produce the final output. This approach is particularly useful in function approximation and pattern recognition tasks.

To use the SourceCode, add the RadialBasisNetwork library to your project. Ensure that all necessary files, such as RadialBasisFunction.cs and RadialBasisNetwork.cs, are included. You can review the provided unit tests in the RadialBasisNetworkTest project as examples of how to initialize and utilize the network. The code is self-contained, fully documented, and licensed under MIT, making it straightforward to integrate and customize for your specific needs.
