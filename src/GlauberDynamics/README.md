# Glauber Dynamics Algorithm Guide

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Glauber Dynamics is a stochastic simulation algorithm used to model the evolution of spin systems in statistical physics, particularly within the Ising model framework. In this method, individual spins in a lattice are updated randomly based on their local environment. At each simulation step, a random spin is chosen and its change in energy (ΔE) is calculated by considering interactions with its neighboring spins as well as any external field. The probability of flipping the spin is determined by the Boltzmann factor, allowing the system to mimic thermal fluctuations and eventually reach equilibrium.

To use the SourceCode, compile the project using your preferred C# development environment such as Microsoft Visual Studio or the .NET CLI. The solution is organized into two main projects: one containing the core implementation (including classes like IsingModel and GlauberDynamicsSimulator) and another with unit tests built with MSTest. Begin by building the solution and running the tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly. You can then modify parameters—such as lattice size, temperature, coupling constant, and external field—to explore various simulation scenarios.
