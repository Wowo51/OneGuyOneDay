# Chien Search Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

ChienSearch is a robust recursive algorithm designed to find the roots of polynomials over finite fields. It utilizes recursive Horner's method to efficiently compute polynomial values and identify candidates that satisfy the equation f(x) â‰¡ 0 mod modulus. The algorithm is supported by comprehensive unit tests that validate its functionality and reliability.

To use the SourceCode, open the solution file (ChienSearch.sln) in Visual Studio, build the project, and run the provided tests to ensure everything is properly configured. The code organization is clear and modular, making it easy to integrate into your own projects and extend as needed.
