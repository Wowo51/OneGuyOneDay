# StoogeSortAlgorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

StoogeSort is a recursive sorting algorithm that works by comparing the first and last elements of a segment and swapping them if necessary. It then recursively sorts the initial two-thirds of the array, followed by the final two-thirds, and finally the initial two-thirds again to achieve full ordering. While not efficient for large datasets, this algorithm serves as a compelling example of recursive sorting techniques.

To use the SourceCode, integrate the StoogeSort library into your C# project, reference the StoogeSorter class, and call the Sort method with your array. The included unit tests demonstrate various scenarios—such as handling duplicates and unsorted arrays—to validate the algorithm's correctness.
