# GradientDescent Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

GradientDescent is an iterative optimization algorithm designed to find a local minimum of a function. It works by updating parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function, effectively "descending" towards the minimum. To use the SourceCode, build the solution with Visual Studio or the .NET CLI and run the provided unit tests to verify its functionality. The codebase is organized into separate projects for the main library and its tests, ensuring clear structure and maintainability.
