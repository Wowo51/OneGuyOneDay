# LempelZivBonwick Compression Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The LempelZivBonwick algorithm is a lightweight, efficient lossless compression algorithm that uses a sliding window mechanism to detect repeated sequences in data and encode them as back-references. This implementation in C# provides two primary functions: Compress and Decompress.

To use the SourceCode:
1. Open the provided solution file (LempelZivBonwick.sln) in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution targeting .NET 9.0.
3. Review the unit tests in the LempelZivBonwickTest project for examples of how to integrate and use the compression functions.
4. The library is pure C# with no external dependencies apart from Microsoft's unit testing framework.
5. Enjoy the simplicity and efficiency of LempelZivBonwick in your projects.
