# Sha2Variants Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Sha2Variants algorithm provides implementations for various SHA‑2 hash functions, including SHA‑224, SHA‑256, SHA‑384, and SHA‑512. The SHA‑224 variant is implemented via a custom class, while the other variants leverage built‐in .NET cryptographic libraries. You can use the static methods in the Sha2 class to compute the hash for any given byte array input; each method returns the computed hash as a byte array.

To use the source code, add a reference to the Sha2Variants project or its compiled assembly in your own project. The included well‑documented unit tests (using Microsoft’s MSTest framework) demonstrate how to call these methods with sample inputs and expected outputs, ensuring both proper integration and correctness.
