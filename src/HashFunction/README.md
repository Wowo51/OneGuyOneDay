# HashFunction

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

HashFunction Algorithm Help

The HashFunction algorithm computes a hash value for a given input using a simple iterative process. Starting with an initial seed of 17, each character or byte in the input multiplies the evolving hash by 31 and adds the value of that character or byte. The result is an integer hash that helps in identifying data uniquely.

Usage:
- For string inputs: Call Hasher.ComputeHash(string input) to receive the computed hash. A null input returns 0, and an empty string returns 17.
- For byte array inputs: Use Hasher.ComputeHash(byte[] data) with similar handling for null or empty inputs.

The SourceCode in this repository is organized as a pure C# library accompanied by MSTest unit tests. To use the code, compile the solution using .NET 9.0, reference the HashFunction project in your application, and run the tests to verify functionality.
