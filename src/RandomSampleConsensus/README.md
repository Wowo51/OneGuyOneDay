# Random Sample Consensus Algorithm Overview
A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is a robust algorithm designed to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model from a dataset that contains a significant number of outliers. It operates by iteratively selecting random subsets of the data, fitting candidate models, and then determining how many data points (inliers) fall within a predefined error threshold for each model. The model with the highest consensus among the data points is chosen as the best approximation.

To use the SourceCode, instantiate the RansacEstimator class with parameters such as maximum iterations, error threshold, sample size, and consensus threshold. Provide a delegate that constructs a model from a given sample and another delegate that evaluates the error between the model and a data point. This flexible design enables you to apply the RANSAC algorithm to a range of problem domains while ensuring that outlier data does not skew the estimation.
