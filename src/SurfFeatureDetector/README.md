# Surf Feature Detector Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The SurfFeatureDetector algorithm implements a robust method for detecting keypoints in an image using principles similar to the SURF algorithm. It approximates image second derivatives with finite difference methods to compute a Hessian response map and then applies non-maximum suppression over a 3x3 neighborhood to identify significant local responses. Gradient estimation is used to determine the orientation of each keypoint. These keypoints can be used for object recognition, image matching, and other computer vision applications.

To use the SourceCode:
1. Add the SurfFeatureDetector library to your C# solution.
2. Instantiate the SurfDetector class.
3. Call the DetectFeatures method with a valid 2D integer array representing your image.
4. Refer to the provided unit tests for example usage and to ensure proper integration.
5. Customize and extend the functionality as needed, leveraging the clear structure and in-code documentation.
