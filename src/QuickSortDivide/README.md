# QuickSortDivide Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

QuickSortDivide implements a classic QuickSort algorithm by selecting a pivot from the list and partitioning the remaining elements into two sublists: one containing elements less than the pivot and the other containing elements greater than or equal to the pivot. The algorithm then recursively sorts these sublists before combining them with the pivot to produce a fully sorted list.

To use the SourceCode, include the QuickSortDivide library in your C# project, add a reference to the assembly, and call the QuickSorter.QuickSort method with a list of elements that implement IComparable. The provided unit tests illustrate various usage scenarios and ensure that the algorithm works correctly under different conditions.
