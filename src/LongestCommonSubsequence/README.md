# Longest Common Subsequence Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm finds the longest subsequence common to two or more sequences. It employs a dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the LCS between sequences. The algorithm is widely used in diff tools, bioinformatics, and version control systems for comparing changes between files.

To use the source code, add a reference to the LongestCommonSubsequence project in your solution. The main class, LongestCommonSubsequenceSolver, provides a static method ComputeLCS that accepts a collection of strings and returns the longest common subsequence. The method safely handles null or empty inputs. Refer to the included unit tests for examples and instructions on how to integrate and use the library.
