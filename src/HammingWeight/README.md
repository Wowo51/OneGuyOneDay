# Hamming Weight Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Overview: The Hamming Weight algorithm efficiently computes the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of an unsigned integer. It works by repeatedly clearing the lowest set bit until the number becomes zero, which makes it faster than checking each bit individually.

Usage: To use this algorithm, simply call HammingWeightCalculator.Compute with an unsigned integer as input. The library is organized as a standard C# class library and includes unit tests using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting. Open the provided solution in Visual Studio to build the project, run the tests, and integrate the library into your own code.
