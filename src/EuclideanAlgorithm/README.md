#Euclidean Algorithm Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Euclidean Algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers by using iterative division and remainder operations until a zero remainder is reached. To use the SourceCode, include the library in your project and call the static Compute method from the GcdCalculator class. A sample Program demonstrates its usage, and comprehensive unit tests using MSTest ensure its correctness.
