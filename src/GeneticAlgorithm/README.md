# GeneticAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

GeneticAlgorithm is a robust implementation of a genetic algorithm that uses evolutionary principles for optimization. It initializes a population of binary individuals, evaluates their fitness based on the number of true genes, and iteratively applies selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve better solutions. To use the SourceCode, compile the provided project files using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI. Run the included unit tests to verify functionality and make any customizations necessary by adjusting parameters such as population size, individual length, maximum generations, crossover rate, and mutation rate.
