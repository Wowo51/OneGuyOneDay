# KWayMergeAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The KWayMergeAlgorithm is an efficient multiway merge algorithm designed to merge multiple sorted sequences into a single sorted sequence. It leverages a priority queue to always select the smallest available element and can seamlessly handle null or empty sequences. This algorithm is ideal for scenarios where multiple pre-sorted lists must be merged with optimal performance.

To use the SourceCode, include the library in your project and call the Merge method with your sorted collections. The library is accompanied by unit tests written with MSTest for easy verification of functionality. Customize and adapt the functionality to fit your specific use cases.
