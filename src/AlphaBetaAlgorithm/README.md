#AlphaBetaAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

AlphaBetaAlgorithm is a lightweight C# algorithm that approximates the hypotenuse using a combination of maximum and a weighted minimum value. The algorithm computes the greater absolute value plus 0.41421356 times the smaller absolute value to yield an approximation of the hypotenuse.

Using the SourceCode:
The repository contains a Visual Studio solution with:
- A C# library implementing the AlphaBetaCalculator.
- An MSTest unit test project to verify algorithm correctness.
- Additional files including license, build logs, and project metadata.
To use the algorithm, open the solution in Visual Studio, build the project, and run the unit tests to verify functionality. The source code is modular and can be integrated into other projects as needed.
