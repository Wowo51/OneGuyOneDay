# Snapshot Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

SnapshotAlgorithm is a robust algorithm designed to record a consistent global state of a system composed of multiple processes. It works by iterating over a list of processes that implement the ISnapshotable interface, capturing their individual state information, and aggregating this data into a comprehensive snapshot. The modular design ensures that the algorithm can be easily extended or integrated into larger applications.

To use the SourceCode:
1. Compile the code using the .NET 9.0 SDK.
2. The source code is organized into several projects: the core library implementing the snapshot functionality, and a separate test project using MSTest.
3. Review the provided LICENSE.md for legal details.
4. Execute the sample program in the SnapshotAlgorithm project to see the snapshot results printed to the console.
5. Run the tests by navigating to the test project folder and executing "dotnet test".
