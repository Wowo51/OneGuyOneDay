#AlmeidaPinedaBackpropagation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Almeida-Pineda Backpropagation is a recurrent neural network training algorithm that leverages a fixed-point iteration method to compute hidden states and backpropagates errors through both feedforward and recurrent connections to adjust synaptic weights. This iterative process helps the network converge toward desired outputs, making it suitable for learning temporal patterns and dynamic relationships.

How to use the SourceCode:
- Add a reference to this library in your C# project.
- Use the Compute method to obtain outputs from your input data.
- Invoke the Train method with proper input-target pairs and a learning rate to update the network weights.
- Consult the unit tests provided to see practical examples and verify functionality.
- Review the embedded logs in the SourceCode section for details on compiler responses and training cycles.
