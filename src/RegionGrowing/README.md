# Region Growing Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Region Growing is an image segmentation algorithm that expands from an initial seed pixel by including neighboring pixels if their intensity difference from the seed is within a specified threshold. This method is effective for isolating connected regions with similar characteristics in digital images.

To use the SourceCode, compile the C# library project and add it as a reference in your solution. The repository includes comprehensive MSTest unit tests that demonstrate various scenarios and validate the algorithm's correctness, including edge cases such as null images or out-of-bound seed coordinates. Integrate and extend this code as needed for your image processing tasks.
