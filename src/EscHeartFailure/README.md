# EscHeartFailure Diagnostic Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The EscHeartFailure algorithm is designed to assist in diagnosing heart failure by evaluating patient data. The algorithm checks if a patient has symptoms and uses a critical BNP threshold to determine the likelihood of heart failure. When symptoms are present and the BNP level exceeds 100.0, it indicates that heart failure is likely. In cases where BNP levels are borderline or symptoms are absent, the algorithm suggests further testing or indicates that heart failure is unlikely.

To use the SourceCode, add the EscHeartFailure project to your solution and reference it in your application. The solution contains a demonstration program and extensive MSTest unit tests that illustrate how to integrate and use the algorithm. The file structure is organized to separate the main library, tests, and project files, making it straightforward to navigate and maintain.
