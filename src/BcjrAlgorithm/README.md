# BcjrAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The BcjrAlgorithm implements the BCJR algorithm for decoding error‑correcting codes on trellises by performing forward and backward recursions. It computes log‑likelihood metrics using a log‑add operation to combine the forward (alpha) and backward (beta) recursions, determining the most probable transmitted bits. The design emphasizes efficiency and reliability, as demonstrated by comprehensive unit tests.

How to use the SourceCode:
1. Open the "BcjrAlgorithm.sln" solution file in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution to compile both the library and test projects.
3. Run the unit tests in the BcjrAlgorithmTest project to verify the implementation.
4. Integrate or modify the library as needed for your specific error‑correcting code applications.
