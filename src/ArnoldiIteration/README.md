# Arnoldi Iteration Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The ArnoldiIteration algorithm is an iterative method used to construct an orthonormal basis for the Krylov subspace generated by a given matrix and a starting vector. It computes an upper Hessenberg matrix which can then be used for approximating eigenvalues of the original matrix. The algorithm starts with normalizing the input vector and progressively builds the basis by removing components along the previously computed vectors. This process continues for a specified number of iterations or until the residual vector becomes negligible.

To use this source code, include the ArnoldiIteration library in your project. The main classes are ArnoldiSolver for performing the iterations and ArnoldiResult for holding the results. The accompanying tests in the project ensure that the algorithm works correctly for various cases, including non-square matrices, zero vectors, identity matrices, and random matrices. Simply compile the solution using Microsoft Visual Studio or the .NET CLI, and run the tests to verify functionality before integrating into your application.
