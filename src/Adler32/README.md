#Adler32 Checksum Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Adler-32 is a checksum algorithm that offers a good balance of speed and reliability for validating data integrity. It works by initializing two sums and then processing each byte of the input data to update these sums. The final 32â€‘bit checksum is produced by combining these two sums, offering a quick method to detect accidental data corruption.

To use the source code provided in this repository, simply add the Adler32.cs file to your project. Invoke the Compute method of the Adler32 class with a byte array representing your data, and it will return the checksum. Unit tests are included to confirm the functionality and reliability of the algorithm.
