# BeesAlgorithm Guide

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Bees Algorithm is an optimization method inspired by the natural foraging behavior of honey bees. It starts by generating a set of random solutions (scout bees) and then refines the search by exploring the neighborhoods around the top-performing candidates (elite sites). This blend of global exploration and local search helps efficiently locate optimal or near-optimal solutions for complex problems.

To use the SourceCode, compile the project with .NET 9.0 and run the included unit tests to verify its functionality. You can experiment with different parameters—such as the number of scout bees, elite sites, and neighborhood size—by modifying the objective functions and test cases. Detailed inline comments in the code provide additional guidance on adapting the algorithm for custom optimization tasks.
