# LuhnModN Library Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

LuhnModN Algorithm Help:
The LuhnModN algorithm is an extension of the traditional Luhn algorithm that supports alphanumeric characters by allowing a customizable set of allowed characters. It is designed to compute and verify check characters for strings using methods such as ComputeCheckCharacter, AppendCheckCharacter, and Validate. This flexibility enables you to adapt the algorithm to different character sets as needed.

Source Code Usage:
The provided source code is organized into a complete solution with project files and unit tests using Microsoft's MSTest framework. To integrate the library into your projects, include the LuhnModN project in your solution and add a project reference. Then, simply call the static methods of the LuhnModNAlgorithm class to compute check digits or verify data integrity. The codeâ€™s extensive unit tests ensure reliable functionality.
