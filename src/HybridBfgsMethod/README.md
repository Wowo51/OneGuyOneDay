# HybridBfgsMethod Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The HybridBfgsMethod algorithm is a robust optimization algorithm that combines the classical BFGS quasi-Newton approach with hybrid enhancements to improve convergence. It is designed to efficiently locate a function's minimum by iteratively updating the solution based on gradient evaluations and Hessian approximations. The algorithm employs a line search strategy to determine optimal step sizes, ensuring that each iteration moves closer to the minimum.

Usage:
1. Add the library to your project.
2. Instantiate the HybridBfgsOptimizer class.
3. Define your objective function and its gradient.
4. Provide an initial guess, desired tolerance, and maximum iteration count.
5. Call the Optimize method to compute the minimum.
