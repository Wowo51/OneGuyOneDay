# PowerIteration Library Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The PowerIteration algorithm is an iterative method for approximating the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of a given square matrix. It works by repeatedly multiplying a nonzero initial vector by the matrix and then normalizing the result. With successive approximations, the vector converges to the dominant eigenvector and the corresponding eigenvalue can be estimated. This method is widely applied in numerical analysis and various engineering applications where identifying the principal component is essential.

To use the SourceCode, compile the provided C# project using a .NET runtime. The solution includes unit tests (using MSTest) that demonstrate how to invoke the algorithm and validate its output. You can adjust the matrix, initial vector, tolerance, and maximum iterations to suit your specific problem.
