# BuzenAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

BuzenAlgorithm is a robust algorithm for computing the normalization constant, G(K), based on Buzen's method derived from the Gordonâ€“Newell theorem in queueing networks. It iteratively builds this constant by accounting for the provided weights, which typically represent service rates in network nodes.

Usage:
1. Open the solution file (BuzenAlgorithm.sln) in Visual Studio.
2. The solution contains two projects: one for the algorithm library (BuzenAlgorithm) and one for unit tests (BuzenAlgorithmTest).
3. Build the solution and run the MSTest unit tests provided to verify correctness.
4. Customize the algorithm as required for your own performance analysis scenarios.
