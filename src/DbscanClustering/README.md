# DbscanClustering Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

DbscanClustering is a C# implementation of the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. The algorithm groups together points that are closely packed while identifying points in low-density regions as noise. To use the SourceCode, add the DbscanClustering project to your solution and reference it from your test or production projects. Adjust parameters such as 'eps' (the maximum distance between points in a neighborhood) and 'minPts' (the minimum number of points required to form a dense region) to suit your dataset. The included unit tests demonstrate usage and help ensure the algorithm functions correctly.
