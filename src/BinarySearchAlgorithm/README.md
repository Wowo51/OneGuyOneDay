# BinarySearchAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

BinarySearchAlgorithm is an efficient search algorithm that implements the binary search technique in C#. It operates on a sorted array and returns the index of the target element if found; otherwise, it returns -1. The algorithm divides the array in half with each step, ensuring a time complexity of O(log n).

To use the source code, add the provided C# library to your project and reference the BinarySearch class. Ensure that your array is sorted and that the generic Search method is used correctly. The accompanying unit tests serve as examples to demonstrate various use cases and integration methods.
