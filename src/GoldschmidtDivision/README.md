# GoldschmidtDivision Library Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Goldschmidt Division Algorithm is an iterative method that approximates division by converting the operation into a series of multiplicative updates. It normalizes the divisor and iteratively refines an estimate of the reciprocal until convergence within a specified tolerance. This approach can be especially useful in environments where multiplication is more efficient than division, such as certain hardware implementations.

To use the SourceCode, add the GoldschmidtDivision library to your C# project and reference the GoldschmidtDivider class. You can call its Divide method with either default parameters or with custom tolerance and maximum iterations for greater precision. Unit tests written with MSTest demonstrate various scenarios, including handling of zero, negative numbers, and fractional values. Ensure your project targets .NET 9.0 and includes the necessary testing frameworks.
