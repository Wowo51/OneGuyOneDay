A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

PackageMergeAlgorithm is an efficient algorithm for generating length-limited Huffman codes. The algorithm first computes unconstrained Huffman code lengths based on the frequency of symbols and then adjusts these lengths using a package-merge approach to ensure that no code exceeds a specified maximum length. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where strict code length restrictions must be adhered to, such as in data compression and encoding systems.

To use the source code, add the PackageMergeAlgorithm library to your C# project. The solution includes comprehensive MSTest unit tests to verify functionality. Simply build the project using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI, and run the tests to confirm the algorithm operates as expected. In-depth comments within the source files further explain how the algorithm is implemented and can be customized for your needs.
