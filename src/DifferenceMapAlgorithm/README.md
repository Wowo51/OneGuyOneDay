# DifferenceMapAlgorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Difference Map Algorithm is an iterative method used for solving constraint satisfaction and phase retrieval problems. It works by alternating between two projection operators, updating the solution based on the differences computed and modulated by a beta parameter. The algorithm iterates until the change in the solution is below a specified tolerance or until the maximum number of iterations is reached.

To use the SourceCode, simply open the provided solution file in Visual Studio, build the project, and execute the unit tests. The tests demonstrate usage examples and show how to modify the projections to suit your needs.
