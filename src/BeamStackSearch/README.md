# BeamStackSearch Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The BeamStackSearch algorithm integrates beam search with backtracking, balancing the trade-off between memory efficiency and search completeness. It allows your application to efficiently explore possible states with a manageable beam width, while ensuring that potential solutions are not prematurely discarded. The algorithm accepts user-defined functions to determine goal states, generate successors, and score states, making it adaptable to a wide range of search problems.

To get started with the SourceCode:
1. Open the provided solution file in Visual Studio or use the .NET CLI.
2. Build the project to compile the BeamStackSearch library.
3. Incorporate the library into your application by referencing the generated DLL or project reference.
4. Execute the included unit tests to see the algorithm in action and to understand how to integrate it with your own code.
