# CycleSortInPlace Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

CycleSortInPlace is an in-place sorting algorithm that minimizes write operations by rotating elements into their correct positions. It determines the final position for each element and performs cyclic rotations to place items where they belong, reducing the overall number of writes. This makes it especially useful in environments where write operations are expensive.

To use the SourceCode, open the provided solution file (CycleSortInPlace.sln) in Visual Studio. The solution contains separate projects for the algorithm implementation and its accompanying unit tests. Run the tests using Microsoft's MSTest framework to verify the correctness of the implementation. The structured project files ensure a straightforward build and testing process.
