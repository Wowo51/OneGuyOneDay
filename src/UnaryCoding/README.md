# UnaryCoding Library Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The UnaryCoding algorithm represents a non-negative integer n as a sequence of n '1' characters followed by a '0'. For example, the number 5 is encoded as "111110". The library provides two key methods: Encode, which converts a non-negative integer into its unary representation, and Decode, which interprets a unary string and returns the original integer when the format is valid. If the input does not conform to the expected format (a series of ones terminated by a single zero), Decode returns 0.

To use the SourceCode, open the provided solution in your preferred development environment or use the .NET CLI. Build the project and run the unit tests (for example, with "dotnet test") to verify functionality. This self-contained library requires only Microsoft's unit testing framework.
