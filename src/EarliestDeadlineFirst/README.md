# EarliestDeadlineFirst Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm is a scheduling mechanism that prioritizes tasks with the earliest deadlines first. In this implementation, each task is modeled as a ScheduledTask and managed by the EdfScheduler. The scheduler sorts the tasks based on their deadlines and executes them in that order, ensuring that tasks with the most urgent deadlines are handled first.

To use the SourceCode:
- Open the solution file (EarliestDeadlineFirst.sln) in Microsoft Visual Studio or use the dotnet CLI.
- Build the project using "dotnet build" to compile all projects including the tests.
- Execute the tests using "dotnet test" to validate functionality.
- Review the source files for details on the scheduler, task handling, and unit tests.
