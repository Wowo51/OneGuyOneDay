#SieveEratosthenes Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classical and efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified limit. It works by iterating through numbers starting at 2, marking the multiples of each prime as non-prime, and then collecting the remaining numbers as primes.

Usage:
1. Build the solution using Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI.
2. Run the Program to execute the algorithm and display the prime numbers up to the default bound (e.g., 100).
3. Modify the bound in Program.cs as needed to generate primes up to a desired limit.
4. Refer to the provided unit tests for examples and verification of the implementation.
