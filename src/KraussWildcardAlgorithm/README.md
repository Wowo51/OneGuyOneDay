#Krauss Wildcard Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The KraussWildcardAlgorithm is a non-recursive algorithm that efficiently performs wildcard matching. It supports the '?' wildcard for matching any single character and the '*' wildcard for matching any sequence of characters. The design prioritizes performance and simplicity, ensuring that even large inputs are processed effectively.

To use the SourceCode, compile the library using .NET 9.0 and add a reference to the generated assembly in your project. Then call the static method WildcardMatcher.IsMatch with your desired text and pattern. Comprehensive unit tests are provided to demonstrate usage and validate the algorithm's behavior in various scenarios.
