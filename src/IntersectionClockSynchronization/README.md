# Intersection Clock Synchronization Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The IntersectionClockSynchronization algorithm computes the overlapping time interval from a list of time intervals. It iterates over the provided intervals, determining the maximum start time and the minimum end time. If the maximum start time is less than or equal to the minimum end time, the intersection is returned; otherwise, null is returned indicating no common interval exists. This is especially useful for synchronizing clocks or determining a mutual time window.

How to Use the Source Code:
1. Open the solution file in your preferred C# development environment.
2. Review the implementation in IntersectionSynchronizer.cs, where the ComputeIntersection method processes the list of intervals.
3. Run the provided unit tests in the IntersectionClockSynchronizationTest project to verify behavior in various scenarios including overlapping intervals, non-overlapping intervals, and lists containing null values.
4. Use the project structure and accompanying files (such as LICENSE.md and the solution file) as a guide for integration into your own projects.
