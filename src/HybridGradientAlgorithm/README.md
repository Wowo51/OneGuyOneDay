# Hybrid Gradient Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

The Hybrid Gradient Algorithm is a combined approach that integrates Harmony Search, Line Search, and Conjugate Gradient methods to deliver an optimized solution. It starts by using Harmony Search to explore potential solutions, utilizes Line Search to determine a fine-tuning scale, and finally applies the Conjugate Gradient method for rapid convergence. This multi-stage process is designed to effectively balance global search capabilities with local refinement for solving complex optimization problems.

To use the SourceCode, simply compile the solution using your preferred .NET development environment (such as Microsoft Visual Studio). The code is structured within a clear project hierarchy, and unit tests are available to validate functionality. Run the tests using the Microsoft unit testing framework to ensure everything is working as expected. The project adheres to best practices and is fully open-source under the MIT License.
