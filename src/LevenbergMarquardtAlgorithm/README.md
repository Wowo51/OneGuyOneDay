# Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is a hybrid optimization technique that merges the strengths of the Gauss-Newton method and gradient descent to solve nonlinear least squares problems. By dynamically adjusting a damping parameter, it efficiently minimizes the sum of squared residuals even in challenging, ill-conditioned scenarios.

To use the SourceCode, start by reviewing the provided solution structure:
• LevenbergMarquardtSolver.cs contains the core algorithm implementation.
• LinearAlgebra.cs offers helper functions for solving linear systems.
• Unit tests demonstrate usage through various test cases, validating both low-dimensional and high-dimensional problems.

Integrate the solver into your project by supplying:
– An initial guess for the parameters.
– A residual function that computes the errors between predicted and observed values.
– A Jacobian function that evaluates the sensitivity of the residuals to the parameters.

Compile the solution using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI and run the unit tests to verify functionality.
