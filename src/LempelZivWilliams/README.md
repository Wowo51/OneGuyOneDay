# LempelZivWilliams Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The LempelZivWilliams algorithm is a compression algorithm derived from the Lempel-Ziv family. It efficiently compresses data by identifying repeated sequences and encoding them as references to previously encountered data. This lightweight C# implementation is ideal for projects requiring fast and effective compression.

Usage:
1. Include the LempelZivWilliams library in your project.
2. Call the Compress method with a byte array to compress your data.
3. Call the Decompress method with the compressed byte array to restore the original data.
4. Refer to the accompanying unit tests for sample usage and verification.

Further Details:
- The source code is provided separately and is not included in this documentation.
- The algorithmâ€™s simplicity ensures that it is easy to understand, integrate, and extend.
