# StoneMethodSIP Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

StoneMethodSIP is an implementation of the Strongly Implicit Procedure (SIP) designed by Stone for solving sparse linear systems efficiently. The algorithm decomposes the coefficient matrix into lower and upper triangular components, which facilitates iterative refinement of the solution vector. To use the SourceCode, compile the project as a library or integrate it into your C# solution by adding the necessary project references. The library is accompanied by comprehensive unit tests using MSTest to ensure its reliability. Detailed comments within the code further explain the functionality and usage of each component.
