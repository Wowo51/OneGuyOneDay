# MuLawAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The MuLawAlgorithm is an implementation of the μ-law companding algorithm used in audio signal processing to compress and expand the dynamic range of audio signals. The algorithm employs logarithmic encoding and decoding functions to efficiently represent audio waveforms with reduced latency. To use the SourceCode, simply include the compiled library into your project and call the static methods provided by the MuLawCompander class—Encode() and Decode()—to process your audio signals. Unit tests are provided to ensure proper functionality.
