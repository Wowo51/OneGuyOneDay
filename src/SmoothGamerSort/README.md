# SmoothGamerSort Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

SmoothGamerSort is a stable, efficient, and easy-to-understand sorting algorithm. It works by iteratively taking each element from the unsorted portion of the array and inserting it into the correct position within the sorted portion. The algorithm is similar to insertion sort, but it is optimized for smooth and reliable performance on small or nearly-sorted datasets. It supports any type that implements the IComparable interface, making it a flexible choice for various sorting tasks.

To use the SourceCode, include the SmoothGamerSort library in your project by referencing the provided .csproj files. Compile the solution with a .NET compiler and run the unit tests via Microsoft's testing tools (such as the dotnet test command or Visual Studio's test explorer) to see practical examples of how to call the SmoothGamerSort method and integrate it into your application.
