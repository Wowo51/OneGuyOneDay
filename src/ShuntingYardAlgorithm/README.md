# Shunting Yard Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Shunting Yard Algorithm is a classical method for converting infix mathematical expressions into postfix (Reverse Polish) notation. It achieves this by scanning the expression from left to right while using a stack to temporarily hold operators. The algorithm respects operator precedence and associativity, ensuring that the resulting postfix expression can be evaluated correctly.

How to Use the SourceCode:
1. Build the project using .NET 9.0; no external dependencies are required.
2. Run the console application. When prompted, enter an infix expression (e.g., "3+4*2/(1-5)").
3. The application will display the corresponding postfix expression.
4. Execute the MSTest unit tests with the 'dotnet test' command to verify the implementation.
