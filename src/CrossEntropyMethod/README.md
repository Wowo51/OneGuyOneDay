# Cross Entropy Method: Optimization Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Cross Entropy Method algorithm is a Monte Carlo optimization technique that iteratively updates a probability distribution over potential solutions. In each iteration, candidate solutions are generated by sampling from a normal (Gaussian) distribution using current parameters. The best-performing samples (the elite set) are then used to update the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, steering the search toward promising regions of the solution space until convergence.

To use the SourceCode:
1. Open the provided solution in Microsoft Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution to compile the CrossEntropyMethod library.
3. Add a reference to the compiled CrossEntropyMethod library in your project.
4. Instantiate the CrossEntropyOptimizer class, define your objective function (a function that accepts a double array and returns a double), and configure the initial mean and standard deviation.
5. Call the Optimize method to perform the optimization.
6. Consult the CrossEntropyMethodTest project for unit tests and usage examples to better understand the implementation.
