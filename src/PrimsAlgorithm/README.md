# PrimsAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

PrimsAlgorithm is a greedy algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, connected graph. It begins with an arbitrary vertex and iteratively selects the edge with the smallest weight that expands the tree until every vertex is included. The provided C# source code is organized into clear, modular components including classes for Graph, Vertex, and Edge, along with a static method ComputeMST that implements the algorithm.

To use the SourceCode, incorporate the library into your project either by referencing the project or by directly including the source files in your solution. The unit tests, built using Microsoft's MSTest framework, offer examples for validating and running the algorithm. You can customize the functionality as needed to suit your specific requirements.
