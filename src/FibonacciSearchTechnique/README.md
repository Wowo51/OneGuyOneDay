# Fibonacci Search Technique

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Fibonacci Search Technique is an algorithm designed to efficiently locate an element in a sorted array by leveraging Fibonacci numbers to partition the search space. Unlike binary search, it uses a sequence of Fibonacci numbers to determine the next index to probe, which can offer benefits in scenarios where division of the array does not result in equal partitions.

To use the SourceCode:
- Add the FibonacciSearchTechnique project to your solution.
- Reference the FibonacciSearchTechnique namespace in your C# project.
- Call the static method FibonacciSearch.Search with your sorted array and the target value.
- Run the provided MSTest unit tests to verify functionality.
