# OneAttributeRule Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The OneAttributeRule algorithm is designed to ensure that the custom attribute (OneAttributeRuleAttribute) is applied only once to any given target, such as classes, methods, or properties. It enforces a single attribute usage rule to maintain code clarity and prevent redundant annotations. To use the algorithm, include the OneAttributeRule library in your project. Simply apply the OneAttributeRuleAttribute to your desired code element and run the provided MSTest unit tests to verify that no duplicate attribute applications occur. This helps maintain consistency and avoid potential conflicts in attribute processing.
