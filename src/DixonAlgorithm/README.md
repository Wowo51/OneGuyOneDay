# Dixon Algorithm Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The DixonAlgorithm is an integer factorization algorithm based on Dixonâ€™s method that collects smooth relations from a chosen factor base and employs linear algebra over GF(2) to discover nontrivial factors of composite numbers. The provided SourceCode demonstrates a complete implementation of the algorithm along with a comprehensive suite of unit tests to verify its functionality.

To use the SourceCode, open the solution in Visual Studio, build the project, and run the unit tests. Once verified, you can integrate the library into your own C# applications for efficient integer factorization.
