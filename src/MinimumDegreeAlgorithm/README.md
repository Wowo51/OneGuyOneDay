#Minimum Degree Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Minimum Degree Algorithm computes an elimination ordering for a graph by repeatedly selecting the vertex with the smallest degree. This approach minimizes the fill-in during sparse matrix factorization, such as in Cholesky decomposition. By eliminating vertices with fewer connections first, the algorithm helps preserve the sparsity of the matrix.

To use the source code, compile the provided C# projects and run the application. Unit tests using MSTest are included to verify the algorithmâ€™s behavior. You can study the Main method for a usage example and refer to the tests to understand how to input different graph structures for experimentation.
