# VectorQuantization Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The VectorQuantization algorithm is designed to efficiently compress high-dimensional data by representing it with a finite set of representative vectors, known as a codebook. The algorithm begins by initializing the codebook—typically by selecting a subset of the input data—and then iteratively refines the code vectors. In each iteration, every data vector is assigned to its nearest codebook vector based on Euclidean distance, and the codebook vectors are updated as the centroids of their assigned groups. This process minimizes the quantization error and produces a refined codebook that effectively summarizes the original dataset.

To use the SourceCode, simply incorporate the provided C# files into your project. The main implementation is found in the VectorQuantizer class, with the Train method for building the codebook from your input data and the Quantize method for mapping new data vectors to their nearest codebook indices. A comprehensive suite of unit tests using Microsoft's MSTest framework is also included to verify the correctness and robustness of the algorithm. Running these tests will help ensure that the library functions as expected before integrating it into your application.
