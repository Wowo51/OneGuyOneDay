# Damerau Levenshtein Distance Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Overview:
The Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm measures the difference between two strings by calculating the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions) required to transform one string into the other. This makes it particularly useful in areas like spell checking, natural language processing, and approximate string matching.

How to Use:
- Call the static method ComputeDistance in the DamerauLevenshtein class, passing in the two strings you wish to compare.
- The method returns an integer representing the edit distance between the two strings.
- The solution is split into a library project containing the algorithm implementation and a test project that utilizes Microsoft's unit testing framework to ensure correctness.
- Reference the library in your project to access the Damerau-Levenshtein Distance functionality.

Source Code:
The provided source code includes clear implementations and unit tests to validate all aspects of the algorithm. Use the unit tests as examples of how the algorithm responds to various inputs.
