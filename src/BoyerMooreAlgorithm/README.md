# BoyerMoore Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The BoyerMoore algorithm is an efficient string search method that leverages both bad-character and good-suffix heuristics to quickly locate a substring within a larger text. By preprocessing the search pattern, the algorithm determines optimal shifts to bypass unnecessary comparisons, which significantly improves performance for most search cases.

To use the SourceCode, integrate the provided C# project into your solution and reference it from your application. The code comes with comprehensive unit tests that demonstrate the algorithmâ€™s usage and help verify its functionality. These tests serve as practical examples to ensure smooth integration and correct operation in your environment.
