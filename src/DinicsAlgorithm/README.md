# DinicsAlgorithm Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Dinic's Algorithm is an efficient method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network. It works by first constructing a layered graph via a breadth-first search to determine the levels of nodes, then uses depth-first search to send blocking flows until no more augmenting paths exist. This approach makes it well-suited for networks of various sizes and complexities.

To use the SourceCode, build the C# projects with your preferred .NET environment. Run the accompanying console application to see a practical demonstration of the algorithm, or execute the MSTest unit tests to verify functionality and performance. The library's modular design allows for easy integration into other systems, and detailed comments within the code assist in understanding each component of the implementation.
