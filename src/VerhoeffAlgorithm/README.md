#Verhoeff Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Verhoeff Algorithm is a checksum algorithm designed to detect data entry errors in numeric identifiers. It uses a combination of multiplication, permutation, and inversion tables to calculate and verify a check digit. To use the SourceCode, include the VerhoeffAlgorithm library in your project, reference the Verhoeff class from the VerhoeffAlgorithm namespace, and call its methods (Validate, ComputeCheckDigit, AppendCheckDigit) as needed. The repository also contains unit tests that demonstrate its functionality and ensure reliable integration.
