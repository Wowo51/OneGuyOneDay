# FlameClustering Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The FlameClustering algorithm is a fuzzy clustering method that groups data points based on neighborhood density and distance weights. It identifies core points with sufficient neighboring data points and assigns fuzzy membership values using an exponential decay function determined by the distance to cluster centers. To use the SourceCode, compile the provided solution in Visual Studio or use the dotnet CLI. The included unit tests offer examples and validation of the algorithmâ€™s functionality under various scenarios. Integrate the FlameClusteringAlgorithm class into your project and run the tests to verify correct behavior.
