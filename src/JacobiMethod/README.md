# JacobiMethod Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The JacobiMethod algorithm is an iterative technique used primarily to compute the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix. The method works by repeatedly applying orthogonal rotations to eliminate the off-diagonal elements, thereby transforming the matrix into an approximate diagonal form whose entries correspond to the eigenvalues. Additionally, a variant of the algorithm is provided to solve linear systems via iterative refinement.

To use the SourceCode, compile the project with .NET 9.0 and run the included MSTest unit tests to verify functionality. The solution is organized into a library and a test project, allowing you to explore the implementation details and integrate the library into your own C# applications as needed. Detailed usage examples and test cases can help guide you through adapting the algorithm to your requirements.
