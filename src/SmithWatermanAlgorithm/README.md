#SmithWaterman Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

SmithWatermanAlgorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for local sequence alignment. It identifies the optimal matching segments between two sequences by managing match scores, mismatch penalties, and gap penalties. This algorithm is especially useful in bioinformatics for comparing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. To use this library, compile the project with .NET or Visual Studio, then run the executable and input the required sequences along with your desired scoring parameters. The Align method returns the alignment score and the aligned sequences, making it straightforward to integrate into your workflow. The included unit tests ensure reliability and correctness of the algorithm.
