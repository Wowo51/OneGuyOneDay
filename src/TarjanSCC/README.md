# TarjanSCC Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

TarjanSCC is an algorithm for finding strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph. It employs a depth-first search strategy along with index tracking and low-link values to efficiently identify cycles and connected components within the graph. The algorithm is based on the original work of Robert Tarjan and has been optimized for clarity and performance in C#.

How to use the SourceCode:
1. Clone or download the repository to access all the files.
2. Build the solution using your preferred .NET build tool (e.g., Visual Studio or "dotnet build").
3. Run the unit tests with "dotnet test" to verify the algorithm's correctness.
4. Integrate the library into your projects by referencing the provided TarjanSCC project.
