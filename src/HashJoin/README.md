#HashJoin Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The HashJoin algorithm efficiently joins two collections by building a lookup dictionary from the left collection and then iterating through the right collection to find matching keys. This method minimizes the number of comparisons and is highly effective for merging large data sets. The algorithm handles duplicate keys gracefully and ensures optimal performance even when the collections are sizable.

To use the SourceCode, simply add the HashJoin library to your project and reference the HashJoinMethod. Pass your left and right collections along with appropriate key selector and result selector functions. The included unit tests in the accompanying test project demonstrate how to use the algorithm in various scenarios, such as handling duplicate keys and verifying behavior with null parameters. This robust design ensures that the algorithm performs reliably in real world applications.
