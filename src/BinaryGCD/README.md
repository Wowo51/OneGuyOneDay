# BinaryGCD Library Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The BinaryGCD algorithm efficiently computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using binary operations. It handles cases where one or both input integers are zero, then eliminates any common factors of two by repeated shifting, and finally uses iterative subtraction to converge on the GCD. This method is efficient because it replaces division operations with faster bit shifts and subtraction.

To use the SourceCode, open the BinaryGCD solution file in an IDE such as Microsoft Visual Studio. Compile the projects and run the application with two integer command-line arguments, or execute the provided unit tests (in the BinaryGCDTest project) to verify the algorithm's correctness.
