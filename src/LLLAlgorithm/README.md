#LLL Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The LLLAlgorithm algorithm is an implementation of the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm. It efficiently transforms a given lattice basis into a nearly orthogonal set of short vectors in polynomial time. To use the source code, include the project in your solution and reference the LLLAlgorithm library. Then call the LLLReducer.Reduce method with your lattice basis (an array of double arrays), optionally specifying the delta parameter to adjust the reduction quality. Comprehensive unit tests in the repository demonstrate usage scenarios ranging from empty inputs to non-orthogonal bases.
