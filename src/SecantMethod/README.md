# Secant Method Solver

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Secant Method is a numerical algorithm for finding the roots of a function. Unlike methods that require the derivative of the function, the Secant Method approximates the derivative by using values at two distinct points. This makes it especially useful when the derivative is difficult or impossible to compute directly.

To use the SourceCode, include the library in your C# project and reference it accordingly. Define the function whose root is to be computed and supply two initial guess values. Adjust the tolerance and maximum iteration parameters based on your needs. The method will iteratively improve the approximation until the result is within the specified tolerance. Unit tests provided with the source demonstrate various usage scenarios and ensure the accuracy of the algorithm.
