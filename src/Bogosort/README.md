# Bogosort Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Bogosort is a highly inefficient sorting algorithm that repeatedly shuffles an array until it is sorted. While this approach is impractical for large datasets, it serves as an entertaining and educational example of randomness and brute-force algorithm design.

To use the SourceCode, open the provided solution in your preferred C# development environment (such as Visual Studio). Build the project and run the included unit tests to see the algorithm in action. You can also reference the library in your own projects and call the BogosortAlgorithm.Sort method to sort arrays under controlled conditions.
