# Faugere F4 Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Faugere F4 Algorithm is an advanced method for computing Groebner bases in polynomial rings. It optimizes the reduction process by batching S-polynomial reductions and integrates seamlessly with C# projects. The algorithm is implemented in the FaugereF4Algorithm library, which also includes a placeholder implementation for the F5 method.

To use the source code, open the provided solution in Visual Studio or use the dotnet CLI to build and run the project. Review the sample usage in Program.cs and the accompanying unit tests for guidance on polynomial arithmetic, reduction, and Groebner basis computation. The unit tests serve as examples for defining polynomials, performing operations, and validating outcomes.
