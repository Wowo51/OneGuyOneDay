# HindleyMilnerAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The HindleyMilnerAlgorithm implements the Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm in C#. It provides a comprehensive set of classes to represent lambda calculus expressions—including variables, lambda abstractions, applications, and let-bindings—as well as types, type schemes, and substitution mappings. The heart of the library is the AlgorithmW function which infers types for expressions by generating type constraints and resolving them through unification. This approach supports polymorphism and allows inferred types to be generalized when necessary.

To use the SourceCode:
1. Open the provided solution file in Microsoft Visual Studio.
2. Build the project using the included project files (e.g., HindleyMilnerAlgorithm.csproj).
3. Run the unit tests to validate the functionality and understand example usages.
4. Reference the compiled library in your own projects to perform type inference on functional expressions.
5. Explore the source code for detailed insights into the algorithm’s implementation and its application to lambda calculus.
