# BubbleSort Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

BubbleSort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Although not optimal for large datasets, its simplicity makes it an excellent educational example for learning basic programming concepts such as iteration, comparison, and swapping.

To use the SourceCode, open the provided solution file in Visual Studio or use the .NET CLI. The repository contains separate projects for the BubbleSort implementation and its unit tests. Execute the tests via your preferred test runner (e.g., using the "dotnet test" command) to verify the functionality of the algorithm.
