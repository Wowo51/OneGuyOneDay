# ScoringAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The ScoringAlgorithm implements a Newtonâ€™s method-based algorithm to compute numerical solutions for the roots of a function. It iteratively refines an initial guess by evaluating both the score function and its derivative until the estimates converge within a specified tolerance.

To use the SourceCode, compile the provided C# library and reference it in your project. Call the Solve method with your custom score function, derivative function, initial guess, tolerance, and maximum iteration count. Unit tests are included to demonstrate typical usage and ensure correct behavior.
