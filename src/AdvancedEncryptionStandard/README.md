#AdvancedEncryptionStandard Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

AdvancedEncryptionStandard is a robust, high-performance cryptographic algorithm that implements the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for secure data encryption and decryption. The algorithm utilizes symmetric key encryption to transform plain text into ciphertext using a specified key and initialization vector (IV), providing confidentiality and integrity for data exchange.

To use the provided SourceCode, simply incorporate the AdvancedEncryptionStandard library into your project. Initialize the AesEncryptionProvider with a generated key and IV to perform encryption and decryption operations. The accompanying unit tests serve as a practical guide for implementation, showcasing typical use-cases and error handling. This self-contained library is designed for ease of integration and secure data handling.
