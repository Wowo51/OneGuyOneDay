# SeamCarvingAlgorithm Guide

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

SeamCarvingAlgorithm is a contentâ€‘aware image resizing algorithm that smartly identifies and removes the least noticeable seams from an image, preserving important visual content while reducing its size. The algorithm computes an energy map for each pixel, locates a vertical seam with the lowest cumulative energy, and removes that seam iteratively until the desired dimensions are achieved.

To use the SourceCode, simply include the library in your C# project. Instantiate the SeamCarver class with a Bitmap (or pass null to default to a 1x1 image), and call the Resize method with your target width and height. Review the provided unit tests for practical examples of how to integrate and use the algorithm effectively.
