# Pancake Sorting Guide

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Pancake Sorting is an algorithm that sorts arrays by performing a series of prefix reversals. The algorithm works by identifying the largest unsorted element, flipping it to the front if necessary, and then reversing the unsorted portion so that the largest element moves to its correct position. This procedure is repeated on the remaining unsorted section until the entire array is sorted.

To use the SourceCode, include the PancakeSorting project in your solution and reference it in your application. Then, call the PancakeSorter.Sort() method with the integer array you wish to sort. The repository also contains comprehensive unit tests under PancakeSortingTest, which cover scenarios such as null arrays, empty arrays, arrays with duplicate values, and more.
