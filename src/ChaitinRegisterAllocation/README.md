#Chaitin Register Allocation Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The ChaitinRegisterAllocation algorithm implements a register allocation strategy using graph coloring. It works by constructing an interference graph where nodes represent variables and edges represent conflicts. The algorithm removes nodes with fewer interactions than available registers, pushing them onto a stack, and then assigns registers by popping them off, ensuring that no two interfering nodes share the same register. Use the accompanying source code in your project and run the provided MSTest unit tests to verify correctness. Modify the source code files as needed to adapt the algorithm to your specific requirements.
