# Doomsday Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Doomsday Algorithm is a mathematical method used to quickly determine the day of the week for any given date. It leverages century anchors, year remainders, and month-specific key numbers to compute the weekday in a simple and efficient manner.

How to Use the SourceCode:
• The solution is divided into two projects – one containing the algorithm library and another for MSTest unit tests.
• Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
• Build the projects to compile the library and run the tests.
• The main method, GetDayOfWeek, is provided in two overloads: one accepting the year, month, and day as integers, and the other accepting a DateTime object.
• Integrate the library into your projects by referencing the compiled DLL or including its source files as needed.
