# Euler Integration Algorithm Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Euler integration algorithm is a simple, first-order method for numerically solving ordinary differential equations. Starting from an initial value, the algorithm incrementally computes the next value by adding the product of the derivative (evaluated at the current point) and a fixed step size. While it may not be as accurate as higher-order methods for complex problems, Euler integration offers a clear and accessible introduction to numerical integration techniques.

To use the SourceCode, incorporate the EulerIntegrator class into your project and run the accompanying unit tests to observe its behavior under different scenarios (such as zero, constant, exponential, or randomized derivatives). Adjust the step size and number of iterations as needed to balance performance and precision in your applications.
