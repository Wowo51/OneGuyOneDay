# UnionMergeUnique Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The UnionMergeUnique algorithm efficiently merges two collections into one without duplicates. It handles null collections by treating them as empty and uses a HashSet internally to ensure each element is unique. To use the SourceCode, simply reference the library in your project and call the UnionMerge method with your two collections. The method returns a new list with the union of the elements without repetition. Unit tests provided in the source code demonstrate various usage scenarios and validate the function's correctness.
