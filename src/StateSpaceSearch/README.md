# StateSpaceSearch Algorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The StateSpaceSearch algorithm is a best-first search algorithm designed to explore state spaces in complex problems by leveraging both cost and heuristic estimates. It is conceptually similar to the A* search algorithm. The algorithm begins at an initial state, then iteratively expands the most promising node (based on a combination of accumulated cost and heuristic prediction) until a goal state is reached or no further nodes remain to explore.

How to use the Source Code:
1. Implement the IStateSpaceProblem interface for your specific problem, defining the initial state, goal conditions, neighbor generation, cost function, and a heuristic function.
2. Invoke the StateSpaceSearchAlgorithm.Search method with your problem instance to compute a solution path, which is returned as a list of states from the initial state to the goal.
3. Examine the provided unit tests in the StateSpaceSearchTest project for detailed examples of how to set up your problem and validate the algorithm.
4. Build and run the project in your preferred .NET environment to integrate and test the algorithm in your application.
