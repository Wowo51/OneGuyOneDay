# ReteAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

ReteAlgorithm is an efficient pattern matching algorithm designed for production rule systems. It minimizes redundant evaluations by processing facts through a network of nodes, filtering them via conditions represented by AlphaNodes. Each ProductionRule defines a set of conditions and an associated action, ensuring that the action is triggered only when all conditions are met.

To use the source code, compile the project using the provided .csproj files. The solution is structured with clear separation between the core algorithm and its unit tests. Integrate this library into your own projects to implement robust and high-performance rule-based logic, and refer to the test cases for practical usage examples.
