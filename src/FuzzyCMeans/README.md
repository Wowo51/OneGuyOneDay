# FuzzyCMeans Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Fuzzy C-Means is a clustering algorithm that allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. It iteratively updates cluster centers and membership values until convergence is achieved. The library provides a straightforward implementation of the algorithm in C#, making it easy to integrate with your projects.

To use the SourceCode, include the corresponding project in your solution and reference the provided API. Utilize the FuzzyCMeansAlgorithm.Compute method by passing in your data points, the desired number of clusters, a fuzziness parameter (m), a convergence tolerance, and a maximum number of iterations. The code is accompanied by a comprehensive suite of unit tests using Microsoft's unit testing framework, demonstrating how to deploy and verify the clustering functionality.
