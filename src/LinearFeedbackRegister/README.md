# Linear Feedback Register Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Linear Feedback Register (LFSR) algorithm is a method of generating pseudo-random numbers using a seed value and a tap mask. It works by computing a new bit through a parity calculation on the current state in conjunction with the tap mask, then shifting the state to incorporate this new bit. This process produces a sequence of numbers that mimics randomness and is useful in simulations, cryptographic applications, and digital system testing.

To use the SourceCode, open the solution file in your C# development environment (such as Microsoft Visual Studio), compile the project, and run the unit tests provided. The project is organized with clear separation between the main LFSR implementation and its associated tests to facilitate maintenance and further development.
