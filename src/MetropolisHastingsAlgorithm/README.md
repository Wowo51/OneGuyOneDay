#MetropolisHastings Algorithm Help

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The MetropolisHastings algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method used to generate a sequence of samples from a target probability distribution when direct sampling is challenging. This implementation uses a Gaussian proposal distribution and accepts or rejects moves based on the ratio of the target densities. To use the SourceCode, simply integrate the library into your C# project, define your target density function, and call the Sample method with appropriate parameters including the number of iterations and proposal standard deviation. Unit tests have been provided to ensure reliability and demonstrate proper usage.
