# BailliePSWTest Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Baillie-PSW Primality Test is a robust probabilistic algorithm that verifies the primality of numbers through a combination of tests. It first handles trivial cases and checks for small primes, then performs a Miller-Rabin test with a fixed base, and finally applies a Lucas sequence test to affirm the result. This hybrid approach ensures high accuracy in determining prime numbers.

To use the SourceCode, include the BailliePSWTest library in your C# project by opening the provided solution (BailliePSWTest.sln) using Visual Studio or a compatible IDE. Build the project targeting .NET 9.0 and run the unit tests in the BailliePSWTestTest project using MSTest or the dotnet test command. This will validate that the algorithm works as expected and facilitate integration into larger applications.
