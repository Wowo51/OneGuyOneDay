# NonRestoringDivision Algorithm Guide

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Non-Restoring Division is an efficient algorithm that performs division without requiring a separate restoration step. Instead of restoring the previous state after a negative subtraction, the algorithm conditionally adds back the divisor to correct the partial remainder. This approach produces both the quotient and the remainder in an iterative process, making it well-suited for implementations in both hardware and software.

To use the SourceCode, simply include the NonRestoringDivider class into your C# project. The provided unit tests demonstrate how to invoke the Divide method and validate its output under various conditions, such as handling negative values and division by zero. Build the solution and run the tests using Microsoft's testing framework to verify proper functionality and integration in your own projects.
