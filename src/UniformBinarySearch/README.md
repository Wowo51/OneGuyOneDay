# Uniform Binary Search Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The UniformBinarySearch algorithm is an optimized variant of the traditional binary search, designed to quickly locate an element within a sorted array using a uniform stepping strategy. It leverages bit-level operations to efficiently calculate candidate positions and determine the target element. 

To use the SourceCode, integrate the provided C# class library into your project and reference it accordingly. Detailed unit tests are included to demonstrate proper usage and to verify functionality, ensuring that the algorithm performs reliably in various scenarios.
