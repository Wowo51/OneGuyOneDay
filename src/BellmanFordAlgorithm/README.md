# BellmanFordAlgorithm Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to compute shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph that may contain negative edge weights. It works by repeatedly relaxing each edge in the graph until the shortest path is determined or a negative cycle is detected.

The provided SourceCode contains:
- A complete implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm in C#.
- A set of unit tests to validate the algorithm's correctness.
- Project files and build configuration to compile and run the library.

To use the SourceCode:
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution to compile the library and tests.
3. Run the tests to ensure the algorithm functions as expected.
4. Integrate the library into your project by referencing the compiled DLL if needed.
