# NaglesAlgorithm Guide

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

## Overview

NaglesAlgorithm is an implementation of a packet coalescing algorithm designed to improve TCP/IP efficiency by combining small packets into larger ones before transmission. This reduces the number of small packets on the network, minimizing overhead and congestion.

## How It Works

- Packets are queued using the QueuePacket method.
- The engine maintains a buffer of packets and continuously tracks the cumulative length.
- When the total length meets or exceeds the maximum buffer size, the engine automatically flushes the buffer by concatenating the packets and sending them as one coalesced packet.
- A manual flush is also available to send any remaining packets immediately.

## Using the Source Code

To use the library:
1. Add the NaglesAlgorithm project to your solution.
2. Instantiate the NagleAlgorithmEngine with your desired buffer size and a network sender (an implementation of INetworkSender) or the provided DefaultNetworkSender.
3. Use QueuePacket() to add individual data segments.
4. Optionally, call FlushBuffer() to manually send the buffered packets.
5. Refer to the provided unit tests in the NaglesAlgorithmTest project for example usage and validation.
