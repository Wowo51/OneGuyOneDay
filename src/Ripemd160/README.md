#Ripemd160

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

RIPEMD-160 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit digest. It is designed for data integrity and security in various applications. The algorithm processes the input message in 512-bit blocks through five rounds using multiple parallel operations and non-linear functions. This implementation in C# adheres to a pure approach with no external dependencies besides the MSTest framework for unit testing.

To use the SourceCode, simply add the project to your solution, reference the library, and instantiate the RIPEMD160Managed class to compute hashes. The source includes examples of single-pass hashing as well as incremental processing (using TransformBlock and TransformFinalBlock) to accommodate large or streaming data. The included MSTest unit tests demonstrate usage scenarios and validate correctness.
