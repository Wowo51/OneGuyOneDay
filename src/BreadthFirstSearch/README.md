# BreadthFirstSearch Library Documentation

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

BreadthFirstSearch Algorithm Help:
The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is used to traverse or search tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node (often referred to as the "root") and explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This method is effective for finding the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) in unweighted graphs.

SourceCode Usage Instructions:
To use the source code, open the provided Visual Studio solution file (BreadthFirstSearch.sln) to examine the project structure. Review the Graph.cs file to understand the BFS implementation and see how the algorithm builds and traverses the graph. The Program.cs file contains a sample execution, and the accompanying MSTest unit tests in BreadthFirstSearchTest demonstrate how to verify and use the library.
