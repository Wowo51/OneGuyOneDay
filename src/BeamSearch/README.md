# BeamSearch Overview

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Beam Search is a heuristic search algorithm that examines a subset of nodes at each level of a search tree, focusing on the most promising candidates based on an evaluation (or heuristic) function. By limiting the number of nodes to a specified beam width, it balances the trade-off between performance and solution quality. While it does not guarantee finding the optimal solution, it can quickly produce a good enough result for large search spaces.

To use the provided SourceCode, clone the repository and open the solution in Visual Studio. The code includes the Beam Search implementation along with comprehensive unit tests and project files. Follow the instructions in the accompanying documentation to run the tests and integrate the library into your projects with ease.
