# Quine McCluskey Algorithm Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

The Quine-McCluskey algorithm is a systematic method for simplifying boolean expressions, particularly useful in digital logic design. It reduces a given boolean expression into its minimal form by identifying and combining common terms, ultimately producing the prime implicants. The algorithm efficiently handles both minterms and don't-care conditions, making it ideal for optimizing logic circuits.

How to Use the SourceCode:
1. Include the QuineMcCluskeyAlgorithm library in your project.
2. Refer to the provided classes (such as BooleanTerm and QuineMcCluskey) to understand the underlying implementation.
3. Use the unit tests as examples to build your test scenarios and verify the correctness of your boolean expression simplification.
4. Customize the algorithmâ€™s input (minterms, don't cares, and variable count) as per your digital logic specifications.
