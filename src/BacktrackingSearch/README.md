#Backtracking Search Library

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

Backtracking Search is a recursive algorithm that systematically explores all possible candidate solutions by extending a partial candidate until a complete solution is found or the branch is no longer viable. When a candidate fails to meet the criteria, the algorithm backtracks to try alternate paths. This approach is particularly effective for solving puzzles, constraint satisfaction problems, and other combinatorial challenges.

To use the SourceCode, integrate the library into your project by calling its Solve method. Provide an initial candidate value, a function to check if a candidate is a solution, and a function that generates extensions of the current candidate. The included unit tests demonstrate various usage scenarios, ensuring you can adapt the algorithm to your specific needs.
